It is the natural outcome of what happens if personal finance education as currently envisioned is widely taught. The approach that there are ever any conclusions without doing the work of analysis and understanding the fundamental economics leads to situations where all players are pursuing the same goals regardless of personal preferences and financial means.

There still exists a conventional wisdom that purchasing is necessarily a more efficient way to live than renting. Instead both incur a cost of occupancy, and the additional costs for one are paying someone else to manage the ownership of an expensive asset, and the other are the combination of an often favorable speculative investment and assuming the risk of ownership.

It is clear that very few people in the financial industry had the necessary economics background to understand this.

Things like this bother me.  This submission is just a circlejerk, groupthink, waste of time.  Even the title of this submission bothers me.  Bush Jr's name is not mentioned once. This is an example of how we polarize ourselves from those that do not share our political views and attempt to get a pat on the back by preaching to the choir.  This submission is not asking for discourse on this subject when posted in r/obama.  

It also perpetuates an invalid and unfair relationship between what is happening in the economy to the current president and the party he is from.  After all, there was at one time a Democrat majority during Bush Jr's. terms(citation needed) and I doubt they will receive blame in this subreddit.  

This goes back to the pointing fingers over who was responsible for the economic growth during Clinton's terms.  Bush Sr. and Reaganites claim it was their doing because of their policies.  Clintonites said it was because of their policies.  No one comments on the market just reinventing itself.  Apparently it is only The President of the United States who is capable of changing the economy.  When things went into the shit with Bush Jr. they pointed their fingers at Clinton.  Clearly this thought process is cyclical. 

I'm sure shouts of ""karma whore"" and so forth are annoying but this is clearly just that.  Obama's name is only mentioned twice in the second to last paragraph.

There's more to it than that. I spent some time a while back to try to go through the logic of a pregnant Stanley ""Ann"" Dunham Obama traveling to Kenya to give birth. 

* Kenya is very nearly the antipodal point of the globe from Honolulu, Hawaii. (off by about 500 miles) 

* According to my calculations, the cost of airfare at the time would have been roughly $10,000 a person to go round trip. 

* So 3-month pregnant 18 year old Stanley ""Ann"" and Barack Sr., both college students at the University of Hawaii, are married on Maui in February, 1961.

* They decide to take a honeymoon to Kenya, sometime between the end of Spring semester and August 4, 1961.

* Both college students away from home, they buck up somewhere over $20,000, get their malaria shots, get on a plane and make about a dozen transfers literally halfway around the world just to go back to visit Barack's homeland. 

* This would have taken a pretty good travel agent to book at the time, more likely they would have had a combination of plane, train, and boat rides.

* Oh, and Barack Sr. already has a Kenyan wife and child back in the old country - did he introduce them to his new American wife?

* So suddenly, while having a great time in Kenya on August 4, 1961, Stanley Ann goes into labor, something she didn't foresee happening!

* After the birth in a Kenyan hospital, they get on the phone to the grandparents (long distance around the world in 1961, which probably would have meant talking to 10 different operators to setup the call) to inform them of the good news. 

* But they have a problem - they forgot about Barack Jr.! He needed to be born in America to be a citizen, so they need a favor. 

* They need Papa Dunham to go down to the hospital and bribe them to generate a fake birth certificate to file with Hawaii state, and send the birth announcement to the newspaper, where it is published a few days later.

* Fortunately, Papa Dunham has great connections, as he was able to help them to get their new foreign-born child back to Honolulu through Immigrations and Customs in multiple countries without a passport or any questions.

* Barely a month later, in September 1961, the jetsetting Stanley Ann was visiting relatives in Mercer Island, Washington with her 1 month old child.

* Finally, Barack Sr. graduates from U of H with honors in June, 1962. (Must be a quick study to do so well while doing all that travelling before his last semester!)",68,['Donald Trump'],[],[]

birth certificate. As of a few days ago, the White House
released the birth certificate.

I will tell you right now that I had never given this
""birther"" issue any credit. I watched the hype and the
crazies come out. I completely dismissed the entire ordeal
altogether. In fact, it was not until the White House
released the birth certificate that it had gained my
attention.

I am the studious sort of guy, and I have plenty of time on
my hands. So, I took a close look at this document. While I
would have thought that this issue would have been closed
for good (and, got the crazies to crawl back into their
holes), I found two extremely strange inconsistencies that
merit some attention.

First of all, the birth certificate that the White House
released lists Obama's birth as August 4, 1961. It also
lists Barack Hussein Obama as his father. No big deal,
right? At the time of Obama's birth, it also shows that his
father is aged 25 years old, and that Obama's father was
born in "" Kenya , East Africa "". This wouldn't seem like
anything of concern, except the fact that Kenya did not even
exist until 1963, two whole years after Obama's birth, and
27 years after his father's birth. How could have Obama's
father have been born in a country that did not yet exist?
Up and until Kenya was formed in December, 1963, it was
known as the ""British East Africa Protectorate"". But, this
is not the only thing that I found that just does not jive.

The other item that I looked into was the hospital that
Obama was born in. On the birth certificate released by the
White House, the listed place of birth is ""Kapi'olani
Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital"". This cannot be, because
the hospital(s) in question in 1961 were called ""KauiKeolani
Children's Hospital"" and ""Kapi'olani Maternity Home"",
respectively. The name did not change to Kapi'olani
Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital until 1978, when these two hospitals
merged. How can this particular name of the
hospital be on a birth certificate dated 1961 if this name
had not yet been applied to it until 1978?

Go ahead, look it up. I am not talking crazy talk, these are
the facts. Like I said, I thought that this was a non-issue
until the actual certificate was released. Now that it has
been released, of course I had to look into it. I have found
these issues, now I know that something is up. If you doubt
me, just look at the following resources:

Sure as hell, the hospital part is true, as you can read
about the 1978 merger here.

And you can check when Kenya became independent here:
http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107678.html?pageno=2


**TL;DR** Because Obama was born when Kenya was really known as British East Africa Protectorate and no hospital by that name existed at the time of his birth his birth certificate is fake.
",2011-05-10 23:48:30,obama,t3_h8iox,"Not sure about the Hospital name, but the Father's birthplace is easy to explain. The birthplace on the form is what the parents filled in, so if Obama's father (or mother) wrote Kenya, East Africa on the form, that is what would be there. The Hospital doesn't check to see if that is its real name, heck they don't even check to see if the location actually exists.

Edit. 

Looked up the hospital on Wikipedia.
In 1931, its name was changed to the Kapiʻolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital.

","http://www.benefitspro.com/2011/05/31/govt-cuts-rates-for-hard-to-insure-patients

WASHINGTON (AP) — The government is cutting premiums by up to 40 percent in nearly two dozen states and implementing other changes to make it easier for people with pre-existing medical conditions to get health insurance.

The move Tuesday comes as enrollment in the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan continues to lag far behind expectations, often because people can't afford the premiums or find it too hard to meet enrollment requirements.

The insurance program, part of President Barack Obama's signature health care law, began last summer. It offers health insurance to people with medical problems at prices the average healthy person would pay, although that's not necessarily cheap.

***********So far, about 18,000 people have signed up — well short of government projections that some 375,000 people would gain coverage in 2010.************** FAIL

In her announcement, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said diseases like cancer, diabetes and asthma have pushed up health insurance costs for many, bankrupting families and leaving people's health at risk. She said those people who have been locked out of the market still have a place where they can get immediate coverage.

""This program changes lives and in many cases saves lives,"" said Sebelius. ""We need to continue to find those who are eligible and get them covered.""

Premiums will drop, Sebelius said, in the 23 states and the District of Columbia where the federal government runs the plans directly. The remaining states have opted to take federal money and design their own programs.

Cuts of about 40 percent should be seen in Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, and Virginia, according to HHS. Cuts in other states range from about 2 percent in Mississippi to 26 percent in Indiana.

In Virginia, Sebelius said, consumers will save almost $1,200 a year from the premium reductions. The premium cuts are paid for by the $5 billion allocated to the program, HHS officials said.

For the states that run their own programs, federal health officials are sending out letters encouraging them to review their rates to make sure they are similar to standard rates for healthy people in the current insurance market.

Health and Human Services also is adjusting its eligibility standards in the states with federally run programs.

Beginning this July, people applying for coverage can simply provide a letter from a doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner, dated within the last 12 months, stating that they have, or have had, a medical condition, disability, or illness. Applicants will no longer have to wait on an insurance company to send them a denial letter.

Suzanne Hannon of Fallston, Md., says she had been turned down for insurance because of high cholesterol. She applied to the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, was approved, and then was diagnosed with cancer the next month. She was able to be treated quickly with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation and is recovering with a good prognosis, she said.

""As it turns out, I was able to turn my energy and focus into getting well without the worry of huge bills,"" Hannon said at Tuesday's announcement.

The program will last until 2014, when the new health law requires insurers to accept all applicants regardless of medical history.

In her announcement, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said diseases like cancer, diabetes and asthma have pushed up health insurance costs for many, bankrupting families and leaving people's health at risk. She said those people who have been locked out of the market still have a place where they can get immediate coverage.

""This program changes lives and in many cases saves lives,"" said Sebelius. ""We need to continue to find those who are eligible and get them covered.""

Premiums will drop, Sebelius said, in the 23 states and the District of Columbia where the federal government runs the plans directly. The remaining states have opted to take federal money and design their own programs.

Cuts of about 40 percent should be seen in Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, and Virginia, according to HHS. Cuts in other states range from about 2 percent in Mississippi to 26 percent in Indiana.

In Virginia, Sebelius said, consumers will save almost $1,200 a year from the premium reductions. The premium cuts are paid for by the $5 billion allocated to the program, HHS officials said.

For the states that run their own programs, federal health officials are sending out letters encouraging them to review their rates to make sure they are similar to standard rates for healthy people in the current insurance market.

Health and Human Services also is adjusting its eligibility standards in the states with federally run programs.

Beginning this July, people applying for coverage can simply provide a letter from a doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner, dated within the last 12 months, stating that they have, or have had, a medical condition, disability, or illness. Applicants will no longer have to wait on an insurance company to send them a denial letter.

Suzanne Hannon of Fallston, Md., says she had been turned down for insurance because of high cholesterol. She applied to the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, was approved, and then was diagnosed with cancer the next month. She was able to be treated quickly with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation and is recovering with a good prognosis, she said.

""As it turns out, I was able to turn my energy and focus into getting well without the worry of huge bills,"" Hannon said at Tuesday's announcement.

The program will last until 2014, when the new health law requires insurers to accept all applicants regardless of medical history.

The fact that most people look to the president, not Congress or the private sector, to ""save"" the economy shows the irrationality of that belief.  The president is our national ""father,"" so naturally most people turn to him for their daily assurance that the economy can be controlled.

No matter what the beliefs of a person - atheist, religious, liberal, conservative, whatever - he will either a) have a belief system that gives him the illusion of control over vast and uncontrollable processes, or b) be depressed.

""Ernest"" a proper noun and the name of a person, think you meant earnest...The invasion of Afghanistan had nothing to do with defeating Al-Qaeda, and everything to do with seizing the resources of the country, establishing a new colony, and establishing control of a geo-strategically signifcant region...And here's one for you to ponder...Almost all of the 9/11 attackers were Saudi, none were from Afghanistan, and Bin Laden was found in Pakistan. Saudi Arabia, which is a brutal dictatorship, is a close ally, and Pakistan was at the time the invasion was launched...

Serious human rights and news organisations have rejected the claim that Gaddafi forces were given viagra to carry out rape - this is a crude case of war propoganda. The attack on Libya has nothing to do with helpoing the Libyan people - NATO is bombing them...Just the other day 30 Libyan families have brought a lawsuit against the French government, for human rights abuses in its bombing of innocent Libyan civilians. Like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the attack on Libya is aimed at seizing control of oil. At the same time Obama was talking about the ""Libyan people"", he supported the Saudi invasion of Bahrain, and the massacre of protesters there...

All serious polls demonstrate that the majority of the American population are opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the attack on Libya. What people require is a genuine alternative to the parties of big business, the Democrats and the Republicans...Only the Socialist Equality Party is fighting to provide that alternative....

Your comment on the economy is extraordinary. What planet are you living on? In 2008, the bankers and financial speculators crashed the economy, often, through blatantly criminal practices. No-one has been prosecuted. The Democrats and the Republicans came together to support the transfer of billions of dollars of public wealth to the banks and the corporations that caused the crisis. Now that money is being paid back in the form of cuts to education, health, social spending and jobs...Millions of people are unemployed, college students can't find summer jobs, and people are having their homes foreclosed. Job creation? What are you talking about? ""Wall Street is booming"" - that's right, Obama gave them billions of public funds and now ordinary people are paying for it.

iPhone autocorrect messed up earnest. 
Saudi Arabia may have been the home nationality of the highjackers and bin laden, but clearly it wasn't where he was living. He started in Afghanistan, and left when we invaded it. 
And we drove al queada to the edges along with the Taliban. 

The economy sucks compared to what we'd like. That's obvious. But compared to the nightmare of bush, it's a huge improvement. Do you think depriving Obama of political support somehow does anything other than empower corporate and GOP scum to make things worse?

You are angry he didn't prosecute more. I agree with the sentiment, but judging from reality, all that would have done is give more fodder to the right wing to attack him, and the left would never have showed up to help Obama during the fight. 

Consider the gays: 6 months ago, Obama was a sellout devil and they stayed home in droves. He said be patient. today, they list his achievements for gays as the greatest of any president. Same guy, but he got screwed by pouty children like yourself. 
Do you imagine that he did everything for gays he would have with a democratic house behind him? Or did children screw themselves yet again politically?

Bill Clinton made gay rights his first priority, and got slammed with GOP majority for it. Yet the gays blame bill for don't ask don't tell and DOMA. He signed DOMA because the GOP had the votes to shove it through regardless.

What happened to our 'Bama?

The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can’t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government’s reckless fiscal policies.

Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion.That is “trillion” with a “T.” That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the President’s budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion.

Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some people may wonder why they matter. Here is why: This year, the Federal Government will spend $220 billion on interest. That is more money to pay interest on our national debt than we’ll spend on Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. That is more money to pay interest on our debt this year than we will spend on education, homeland security, transportation, and veterans benefits combined. It is more money in one year than we are likely to spend to rebuild the devastated gulf coast in a way that honors the best of America.

And the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the Federal budget. This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on.

Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to investment in America’s priorities.

Let's take the health care bill, for example.  Mr. Obama stumbled immediately, literally having respected doctors and nurses [arrested](http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/13/baucus_raucus_caucus_doctors_nurses_and) rather than allow them to speak out about single payer.  

His first suggestion was almost an exact carbon copy of the Republican's own platform from a few years before, and in order to get a supposed Republican buy-in, he proceeded to give up even more - and all for nothing, after a year of wasted time, not a single Republican voted for the bill.

Don't get me started on how badly he's done with the debt crisis - threatening Americans with losing SS and Medicare while secretly reassuring bankers that there won't be a default.  Sure, everyone's a Monday morning quarterback, but he's endlessly conceded without gaining anything in return, and it's hard to see how the deficit negotiations could have proceeded any worse than they have.

And then there's his endless alienation of the so-called ""progressive wing"" of the Democratic party.  It isn't just that he hasn't given us anything we hoped for, or that he's gone exactly in the reverse of many of his promises (""most transparent government"" HAH) - it's that he and top members of his Administration constantly express their disapproval and contempt for _the very group that got him elected last time_ - the only reason he got elected is that millions of progressives went out and pounded the streets for him in the hopes of a better world.

I can't pretend to understand what his motivation is for this.  I assume he's trying to appeal to the right, but the right will never vote for Mr. Obama as long as he continues to be Black, and I don't think the few ""independent voters"" who remain really see screwing over your supporters as a character strength.

But it _isn't working._  The Democrats got trounced in the last election, not even because Progressives didn't show up to vote, because they did in their usual decent numbers, but because they didn't go out into the streets to try to convince people how great Mr. Obama was, _because they no longer believed it themselves._

What now has been the result of that?  I will answer my own question.  The result has been division and infighting among the Republicans in the house.  

How was it that LBJ could reach a position that allowed him to push through a Civil Rights Act that became a reality in 1964.  Who did he play to on his way up and how did he get the support he needed from the very element that stood in mortal opposition to it?  You do it by moving inside the swing range of your opposition and you let them demonstrate their weak position.  In this case, it is the absence of a comprehensive overlay of economic relief.  That is demonstrated by their short sighted position on fairness in taxation and a reliance on encumbrances on the public by way of fees and add-ons in service and utility billings.  

Strategy and tactics come by way of life lessons.  This President was a well tended kid who had access to experiences on the streets of Hawaii and by way of exposure to some fairly secular primary schooling in Indonesia.  A person learns a lot from experiences like that.  I believe he will prevail in the presence of the *fluffy biscuit* opposition.

Wait, that's bad?  That seems perfect to me.  People with time and a great interest, those older folks on social security and medicare, will pressure their representatives very hard for a compromise that is fair.  Meanwhile, you reassure the markets to keep the economic recovery on track and keep tacit support from those that are not government dependents.  To me, that's the best strategy one can take.  He doesn't have a choice but to concede some points.  I don't know if you're familiar with how our government works, but he doesn't control the house.  The President can't introduce legislation.  


Umm, he's been the most effective progressive in office since LBJ.  Yeah, he didn't do anything for the Progressive wing.  It isn't like he gave women equal pay for equal work.  Or that he extended hate crime protections for homosexuals.  Or that he got the biggest arms reduction treaty in a generation.  Or that he signed legislation ending DADT.  Yeah, and there's no way that he stopped defending the DOMA.  I mean, could it be possible that he made green jobs explode by percentage in this country?  Is it possible we have higher efficiency standards and more support for renewable energy?  I mean,  there's no way that he ended combat operations in Iraq on schedule and is drawing down Afghanistan just like he said he would.  The largest increase in reform and regulation on financial markets since the Great Depression isn't anything either, I guess.  And yes, his is *by far* the most transparent administration we've ever had, but to be honest, that isn't saying that much.  Still, it is a promise kept, but scoff all you'd like.  He's been a progressive wet dream.  If you told people he'd do all of the above while *singlehandedly and with immense criticism*, save the American auto-industry you'd be thought a mad person.  

He did all this against an opposition that hated him and disrespected him at every turn. He fought the filibuster more in two years than any previous president did during the whole of his term.  That's just phenomenal.  


He throws plenty of juicy meat to progressives, but he has to appeal to independents also.  And he does.  He isn't the progressive president, or even the Democratic president, but our nation's president and he needs to represent *everyone*, even those that didn't vote for him.  It's his job.

I hope you think about them, at least!

&gt; There is a security element in each branch that is independent of the whims of the President that is there to maintain decorum and order.

To quickly summarize, what happened was that the Administration refused to allow _their own supporters_ who were proponents of single payer even to speak at the meetings discussing the health care plan, giving them the most ridiculous run-around.  When they showed up and tried to speak anyway, they were arrested - the Administration emitted an apology _after the whole thing was done_ (i.e. when it made no difference).

And please don't claim that the President is powerless in such situations, because he isn't.  If Mr. Obama had said, ""Let them speak!"", then they would have gotten to speak.

Let me know if you need more information on this matter - I provided links in my original posting, and there are many more you could easily find with a search.

&gt; Are you attributing dictatorial powers to this sitting President?

Actually, I was not - I was pointing out that this President has made bad negotiating decisions like having his own supporters arrested.

But in fact Mr. Obama has absolutely assumed dictatorial powers.  For example, he claims the right to order the assassination of anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time, without due process - even [American citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki#Targeted_killing_and_lawsuit_against_the_U.S.)  

How is this blatantly illegal act not ""dictatorial""?  What could be more ""dictatorial"" than claiming the right to kill _your own citizens_ simply based on your word, with no other evidence or due process?

&gt; What now has been the result of that? I will answer my own question. The result has been division and infighting among the Republicans in the house.

Say, what?!  Let me clarify your claim - you're claiming that the result of the year wasted on the health bill is ""division and infighting among the Republicans in the house.""   

Do you have the slightest proof of that?  I just looked over news articles about the health bill over the last two years or so, and instead of your claim, I see a remarkable consistency of opinion amongst the Republicans - indeed, I couldn't find _one single Republican_ who supported it at any time.

That's a strange argument to justify a bad result.  Why not do a good job in the first place?  Do you think we're going to get a redo in the next five years?  The next ten?  It seems inconceivable in the current political environment.

And the health care bill is critically flawed. It doesn't address the actual elephant in the room - that the US spends far more on health care per person than any other country and gets far less for it.  It isn't severable - a terrible technical flaw that means if any part of it is ruled un-Constitutional then the whole thing is rendered void.

&gt; He doesn't have a choice but to concede some points. 

Please read my posting again.  Yes, when one negotiates one must concede some points.  My point is that he is a terrible negotiator and concedes a lot of points for nothing.

&gt; Umm, 

Translated, ""umm"" means ""You're wrong.""  Why not just say that?


&gt; he's been the most effective progressive in office since LBJ.

Yet of his own free will he's proposed expanded military involvement and spending, while on his own he's proposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare.  How does that work?


&gt; It isn't like he gave women equal pay for equal work. 

I assume you're referring to [the Lilly Ledbetter Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilly_Ledbetter_Fair_Pay_Act_of_2009) - because as far as I know that's all he's done there.  ""The bill amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stating that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new discriminatory paycheck.""  That's _all_ it does.  

It is a valuable law, but a small technical change to a huge bill written two generations ago.  By no stretch of the imagination does this give women equal pay for equal work.

&gt; Or that he extended hate crime protections for homosexuals [and DADT].

Again, valuable but tiny.  Take the [hate crimes bill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard_and_James_Byrd,_Jr._Hate_Crimes_Prevention_Act) - this doesn't actually criminalize anything that wasn't criminal before, it simply allows for greater penalties for existing crimes, and allows a little more Federal involvement in their investigation, to the tune of $5 million a year.  DADT is a _military recruiting bill,_ FFS.  

You should cultivate a sense of history and a sense of proportion.  When the world looks back in ten years, they _aren't_ going to remember the 2010s as ""the period in which gays were finally allowed to serve in the US military"". 

&gt; Yeah, and there's no way that he stopped defending the DOMA.

!  Why was his Administration using our tax dollars to defend it in the first place?  The fact that they stopped doing this after losing repeatedly in court doesn't explain why Mr. Obama was on the wrong side of this issue and continues to be so.

&gt; I mean, could it be possible that he made green jobs explode by percentage in this country? 

""Exploded""?  Compared to which other country?  Near as I can tell, green jobs have increased far slower in the US than in any other industrialized country.  And how did he do this?  With the tiny stimulus bill, a small percentage of it went to ""shovel-ready"" projects that really didn't need the additional funding?

&gt; I mean, there's no way that he ended combat operations in Iraq on schedule

We are _still fighting in Iraq._  American soldiers are _still dying in Iraq_.  There are still 50,000 soldiers in Iraq, and at least as many paid ""military contractors"".  

I note you conveniently forgot that he's started more wars - an official one in Libya, and drone attacks in at least six countries.

We've had two budgets out of Mr. Obama and each case he's increased military spending by _more_ than the rate of inflation.  Now he's proposing to cut Social Security and Medicare, and still not touch the military budget.

&gt; And yes, his is by far the most transparent administration we've ever had,

[The](http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/06/17/transparency) least [transparent](http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/06/09/wikileaks), perhaps?

&gt; The largest increase in reform and regulation on financial markets since the Great Depression isn't anything either, I guess. 

This is an area I particularly know something about, having worked on Wall Street writing mathematical models for mortgage derivatives.  Have you actually looked into this ""reform""?

First, note that nobody went to jail over the massive crimes that were revealed by the global financial crash.  Don't tell me that this never happens - remember [Michael Milken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Milken), during the Reagan Administration, who did hard time for _technical trading violations?_ 

In fact, this Administration allowed many huge companies to plead guilty to actual _felonies_ and yet only pay tiny fines.  And since they've shown a complete disinclination to investigate what happened, it's likely that this would just be the tip of the iceberg.

Second, few of the activities that caused the last crash were in fact rendered illegal - nor did they reinstate the protections that had been created after the previous crash, e.g. [Glass-Steagall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act).

And finally, instead of putting more money into the desperately underfunded organizations that already exist and have jurisdiction over the financial industry, organizations like the SEC and the FBB that have historically been effective in investigating and policing, Mr. Obama instead proposed the creation of yet another agency, and this agency will in fact set the new rules - except the agency has not yet been created so there are in fact no new rules.

&gt; Could you be specific about what you have against my arguments? I'm pretty sure I thoroughly debunked your claims, but maybe I was missing something.

Something?  You missed everything!

It seems to me that you read newspaper headlines only and then filter them through your personal affection for Mr. Obama.  I am sympathetic but I feel you are misguided.

I am a skeptical person who hates to be fooled.  I strongly supported Mr. Obama from fairly early on, even though I was under no illusion that he was ""Progressive"" - I simply thought he was competent and somewhat ethical, though I was saddened by his early reversal on the FISA bill, which I felt was unjustifiable for a Constitutional lawyer.  But you have to take what you can get, and this seemed pretty damn good - I literally wept tears of relief when he was elected.

Within a very few days of his inauguration I read about the first drone attacks against Pakistan, a country with which the US has never been at war, and I started to fell a little sick.  Surely this smart man had to see that the US cannot keep expanding warfare forever?  Surely he will obey the law as he promised?

And since then it's been one disappointment after another.  The debt crisis is the worst disappointment yet.

First, the US government is not broke - it's completely healthy for countries, corporations or families to maintain debt and the US's debt load is perfectly within reasonable bounds - which is why _Treasury rates are at or near historic low levels._ 

The whole idea of a huge organization like the government should be that it's miserly when times are good and spends when times are bad - it acts like a huge heat sink, stabilizing the economy.  If the government responds to a sluggish economy by _cutting_ spending, it's like treating a shock victim by blood letting.

Second, the reason that expenses have grown much faster than revenues is simple - we had the the ""temporary"" wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the ""temporary"" Bush tax cuts that gave away huge sums to the rich, who also looted the economy and then crashed it, walking away financially unscathed and leaving huge obligations to the US government and We The People.

If anyone should be having to tighten their belts after the crash, it's Wall Street, the ultra-rich and the military industrial complex, not people on Social Security and Medicare!

Mr. Obama is frightening the people and reassuring the banks because, in fact, he's proposing a deal that's ruinous to the people.  He brought cutting Social Security and Medicare to the table, no one forced him to do that.  

And the fact is that if the government did default it would eventually be because _Mr. Obama ordered it._  Yes, there's a morass of laws involving this, laws I'm all too familiar with, but when it came down to it, he's the Executive in a country with the most powerful executive branch of any of the major industrialized countries (parliamentary democracies generally having a much greater limitation on the executive).

The correct thing for Mr. Obama to do from the start would be to make it very clear that under no circumstances would the government default.  In fact, there's a strong Constitutional argument that Mr. Obama is obliged by the 14th Amendment not to default, but that's almost beside the point.  

Imagine that the debt ceiling is reached - what happens?  Well, a lot of people in various Federal departments look to their managers for instructions as to what to do, who look to their ministers, who look to the President.

_If the debt ceiling were reached and the President told all Federal departments and organizations to proceed as normal, there is no question that he would be obeyed._

Now, can he legally do this?  Well, he can start wars and order people to be assassinated, so why doesn't he have the power to order ""business as usual"" - to order ""do not destroy the financial system, please""?

Regardless, he has the _ability_ to do it, and the only way it could be contested would be through the courts - it would take years.  Or they could impeach him - for not having the government default - but I don't actually think that's in the list of ""Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.""

And imagine how that would go... ""We're going to continue to hold up the entire government while we try to sue in order to break the country's financial system"" might work up for a month or so, but not for years.

This is one of the times when a _leader_ needs to _lead_ and tell the opposition, ""I'm willing to negotiate with you - but you have a gun pointed at the head of the American people, which is not acceptable, and under no circumstances will I ever pull that trigger.""

But in fact he's scaring the people and reassuring the banks - to prepare us for taking more money away from the 99% and giving it to the 1%.

This article seems to suggest that its not a bad deal for the Dems. And technically, maybe it isn't. But politically, the Dems still look like losers.

CH if you're on Reddit feel free to claim ownership of your words - I thought they offered a great opinion of the article.

*What a dishonest hit-job on Krugman. First, the author flat-out lies about what Krugman wrote in April. Far from ""cheerleading"" for defense cuts, Krugman merely labels the Ryan budget as ""unserious"" for failing to include defense included in the progressive plan. But Krugman has consistently opposed ANY deficit reduction in this economy as contradictory.*

*Second, the author faults Krugman for simply asserting that the cuts are contradictory. Fair enough, but while Krugman may be a political rookie, but he's a foremost expert in depression economics. As matter of macroeconomics and basic math though, is it fair to assume that cutting $750BB of discretionary spending out of this economy will reduce aggregate demand and thereby create a drag on the economy that wouldn't otherwise have been there? I don't know, but Krugman seems to think that it's a fair assumption and the author never even attempts to show how Krugman could be wrong. The Dow certainly seemed to recoil at the deal, and major market analysts seem to be making the same assumptions. Yet the author has no reservations about insinuating that Krugman is a hack for making this point.*

*That said, the author is absolutely right that the actual deal cut far more narrowly than many people on the left had feared. But I fail to see how this is a political winner for Obama.*

*Obama said wanted a grand bargain with everything on the table, ostensibly so he could pivot to job creation before the election. Instead, he got a deal that kicked a lot of the cans down the road. So while Obama certainly did well compared to what the tea party was asking, I fear that he basically has signed on to one more year of deficit reduction completely dominating the agenda. That is, until the GOP pivots for the election and points out, quite accurately, that Obama did nothing after the stimulus to promote job creation.*

*So as I see it, Krugman's larger point is: we have spent the last year talking about deficit reduction - which is contradictory - and now we're going to spend the next year talking about it too. At a time we have 9% unemployment and no plan for creating jobs. At a time when every single public poll shows that voters by large margins want Washington to focus on jobs over deficits.*

*The author never explains how this is good politics for Obama over the course of the next 16 months. But I'm happy to be proven wrong, because the alternative may be too horrific to even consider.*",6,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

Here's an analysis on the topic: http://bigthink.com/ideas/39550

If we adjust the analogy a little, it starts breaking down. You have debt you need to pay. You can manage it, but you decide that's your number one priority and you have to pay it off no matter what. So, instead of eating your bologna, you decide to save even more by only drinking (near-free) water and using all your money to pay debt. It is your number one priority, right? In a few days, you don't have the energy to work anymore. You're fired. Now you've lost your job and your income. You used your savings up to pay debt instead of buying food. You can't pay your debt anymore. You can't buy bologna to regain energy and start working anymore. No one will lend you money anymore or give you food. You're majorly screwed.

Oh, it wasn't a sensible idea to stop eating, you say? You could have not used all your savings to pay your debt, you say? I agree. That's why right now the government should worry about jobs right now, not this debt circus. That's why the government should be buying bologna to eat.

There was time.... like, 3 years ago where a president could have a small majority in congress and get shit done. Obama had that and he blew it. Then people said ""Oh maybe he'll get tough now. Sometimes that happens when a president looses the majority"" and they're right about that last part. Look at what Clinton did! But Obama? No. Nothing.

He's the only president who's campaign I've donated money to. The only one I've ever been truly proud to vote for. He will not get my vote again. ",-2,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

If the U.S had defaulted it would have forced spending cuts and the u.s would have been able to run up less debt in the future. It was win/win for the tea party.

The problem lies not in the small mindedness of the electorate, but rather in the fact that you do not have a preferential voting system. In other countries, (such as my own, Australia) we can vote third party without effectively supporting the Liberal party, (conservatives) by preferencing a left wing party like the Greens first, and placing Labor (centre left-ish) second. This means that if the Greens do not win the seat, they still get the electoral funding accorded to every vote won, but my vote flows on to Labor. 

If you want third parties to have a chance, campaign for electoral form. Until you do, you're just pissing against the wind and helping the Republicans to gain power.

His roomate Sohale Siddiqi indicated Obama itially felt alienated, felt ""very lost,"" and used drugs to get high, which could have led to low grades initially. The roomate indicates that he then turned serious and ""stopped getting high."" Obama transferred to Columbia because he was concerned with urban issues. Based on his overall undergraduate GPA of less than a 3.3, Mr. Obama's admission to Harvard Law School may reflect affirmative action statutes, low grades early, then higher grades later (purely speculation) and/or other factors.

Do you really not know?  That's pretty fucking basic, if you're arguing military policy, you should really know those things.  Here, let me make it easy... Look at Germany and Korea. Those are non-combat troops.  Now look at Afghanistan. Those are combat troops. Understand?

Again, here you go not knowing things. He was talking specifically about Iraq, not Afghanistan.  Now, I can already tell you're pretty fucking uninformed so it doesn't surprise me that you had no idea that not long after that statement Bush made an agreement with the Iraqi government and signed an agreement that established timetables.  That Aug '10 date that Obama had to get the troops out? He didn't pull that out of his ass, that was America's side of the bargain.  Like I said, he did *exactly* what he said he'd do.

I've been refuting each claim here. Obama promised to get out of the wars, and criticized purposeless wars. Instead, he's began several of his own. He strongly implied that we would be quickly out of Afghanistan during the campaign, and then when he was elected, said we'd stay only until 2014, and now he's strongly considering staying there till 2024. 

I didn't know I was supposed to pay so much attention to your stupid username. FYI, it *is possible* to use 'man' as a suffix, like Congressman or .

&gt;grandmother

Seems we are [both right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelyn_Lee_Payne_Dunham).  She was a bank executive starting in the early 70's (I wonder how much she actually got paid, relative to her male peers), and lived in the same small apartment where she helped raise Barack Obama until her death.

&gt;ELEMENTARY school

I taught at a private school in Hawaii.  You wouldn't believe how competitive the elementary schools are.  When there are 3 kids applying for every 1 position, there are many variables involved.

I also did not say he got all his education funded by financial aid.  Financial aid is exactly that, aid provided to supplement what the student cannot cover.  I am not surprised that his grandparents helped, and in fact that is quite normal for Hawaii extended-family living arrangements.

&gt;Anecdodle evidence != proof, sorry chemistry ""teacher""

[1.8%, based on 2000 census (2.8% when combined with other races)](http://www.infoplease.com/us/census/data/hawaii/demographic.html)

The 2000 census also confirms (using the 2.8% value) that Black/African American proportions in Hawaii are only one-fifth [(21%)](http://web.aloha.com/demographics.html) that of the nation as a whole.

[1.6%, based on 2010 census](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii#Race_and_ethnicity)

&gt;*Citation needed

No, I cannot provide a study, but my own experience in school supports it.  The lone black kid at my elementary school in Hawaii was teased mercilessly, named ""Washington"" (as if that was supposedly ""typical""), and treated as entirely ""other"".  He had to leave the school within a month because, as we were told later by our teachers, he received more racism in pluralistic Hawaii than he did when living in the South.

I also grew up hearing about the occasional (too anecdotal for you, I suppose, but nevertheless an ""eyewitness"" account) TV report about racism being reported in the schools, and African American parents having to sue the schools for lack of prevention and awareness.

I appreciate the fact you provided about Obama's grandmother.  That helps to make sure we are all receiving real facts before making our own judgments.  You may wish to conclude with your *ad hominem* attacks.  That's fine by me, since there is hardly an audience for you to sway in this obscure and weakly supported post.

Perhaps if I were checking for details, I would have noticed your persistent *ad hominems* in your comment history and not bothered.  Perhaps someday civility will wear off on you and you might actually use real argumentation to say something that might change someone's mind.

I particularly agree that China is wrong in manipulating its currency and that some sort of punitive action should be taken (but not by the US, because this would cause a currency war, but by the WTO).

When I said ""let the Chinese have the manufacturing business"", I meant the ""low-value"" manufacturing business. I understand the US is very good at high-value manufacturing, and there are a lot of good reasons to keep that in the US. In fact, despite free trade, American companies have not yet moved these to China and Chinese companies have had trouble copying the processes and products. This is the single most valuable advantage the US has and shouldn't lose.

&gt; Employers aren't willing to pay enough for trained individuals or willing to train others

I have a big problem with this statement. Prices, including the price of labor (wages), are set by supply and demand. If you think you should be paid more, show your employer why. What added value are you bringing to the table?

If companies are not paying ""enough"" for ""trained individuals"", it isn't because they are greedy. It's because they really don't need them that much (i.e., the costs are higher than the benefits of hiring). When the business case is there, companies WILL pay a premium for trained individuals.

&gt; There are other issues in general with the U.S. economy that make it less favorable to do business here - again not something stopping free trade will help in the slightest - like a lack of investment into infrastructure, and a lack of a working health care system that mitigates costs to employers and workers.

I agree 100%. And yet, Obama has proposed great plans to solve these 2 issues and the Republicans have blocked or tried to block these plans over and over again. These plans are one of the main reasons I support Obama and his administration.

&gt; Going to college and going into debt isn't the best plan either.

Allow me to clarify. I never suggested you go into college. You can train yourself. Buy books, so on. I am currently learning to program, on my own, with no help other than books and online resources. It will take time, but I'll get there eventually. Also, I strongly advocate government policy that favors training programs to match employment needs and labor offerings. I don't think there's enough of this. Bill Clinton has been advocating these programs for a long time now, though.

&gt; it can't be one that relies on people moving from place to place, even inside the U.S.

Why not? As long as the infrastructure is there? Unless you mean, ""because of the homeownership issue"", at which I would respond, ""then rent, don't buy"".

Yes. But the main impediments for Obama have more to do with global capital and the defense industry, less so Republicans (EDIT: his conflict is with Republicans insofar as they are a mouthpiece for these industries, but it's also with Democrats in that respect).

That said, he's better than ""bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran"" McCain, and a lot better on social issues (which rochdude has outlined above) than his predecessor.

However, the legislation and policies the Obama Administration have been pursuing have been center-right and a sort of ""fiddling around the edges"".  So there is a substantial gap between the substantive messaging of his 2008 presidential campaign and the reality of the past few years which is not reflected in the sort of ""promises kept"" metrics like what can be found at [PolitiFact.com](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/).  Specifically there has been no rollback whatsoever of the most egregious practices and polices which were brought in by the Bush Administration.

Personally, as a someone who voted for Obama, I feel that this represents the most dramatic bait &amp; switch maneuver in presidential electoral politics in my memory.  I have come to the conclusion that one of the reasons this is true is the enormity of the body of so-called ""profession bureaucrats"" in Washington D.C. that it is simply not possible to to sustain the sort of Human Resources hiring &amp; firing effort that would be required to replace the ideologues within the 4 year presidential term.  One other reason is that both parties raise money and campaign in the same broken system, so have similar incentives (many of which are both perverse and contrary to those of their constituents).

The consequence of all that is that consensus of Washington D.C. governance is insular, slow to change, completely add odds with the center of public opinion and priorities, and completely incapable of arresting this ugly descent into extreme ideologies and ridiculous partisanship.

It's also clear that the most activated and agitated Americans are so highly propagandized any social change movement which they would participate in would most likely have outcomes which are substantially worse than the status quo.  Moreover, the United States has an enormous state security apparatus and any attempt for social change which is outside of the system would be branded as terrorism and create an even more totalitarian response.  

So my thinking is that the continued failure of the United States to compete with other industrialized economies combined with the continued moving away from the same economies from depending on America economic leadership (the end of the dollar as the world's only reserve currency, the only currency to purchase oil, or the American consumer to buy the goods that you produce... for example) will eventually create an economic crisis which forces the U.S. to chose between its global military empire or the things in the rest of the industrial democracies take for granted (like fully maintained infrastructure, basic social safety net, and some sort of minimum availability of education / health care)... but because they are trapped by debt of all descriptions and ideological extremism not both.

In my opinion it's this sort of follow on economic crisis which is necessary and I am not sure that it's possible for a few people outside of power to accelerate its arrival.  Certainly the Republicans with their 100% rejection of taxation and 99% embrace of gigantic military spending are doing a remarkable job forcing this sort of crisis to come sooner rather than later but I think it's hard to make an argument that this is their intent.

However, unless something changes (like thousands of partispants deciding to allow themselves to be arrested on false grounds and demand a jury trial, which itself could be also disrupted) it's hard to see how they make the transition from political protest to actual change in the structure political system.  Also one thing that I see is a major weakness of these protests is that the most lucid and informed comments are almost universally along the lines of ""what we have now is terrible, we need to go back to x"" (like bringing back Glass-Steagall) instead of promoting the idea of ""what we have now is terrible, we need to move forward to x"".  After all the most accurate thing that can be said of structures of the capitalist economies, pre-financial crisis / great recession is that they lead directly to this crisis.

But assuming for the sake of discussion that the transition is made from protest to actual political change, how do you engineer a change in social and political structure without changing the actual motivations and incentives of politicians? This insinuates changing campaign finances, which subsequently requires also changing redistricting and voting systems. Which is simply not going to happen with any currently serving politician or major party in power.  It's clear to me that ""vote the bums out"" campaigns almost always turn into ""Vote in extreme ideologues who inflame the primary voter"" events... That's just more of what the U.S. has had since I started paying attention to national politics in the early '70s.

Personally I think the next most successful economy probably will be a sort of post-capitalist and post centralized amassment power &amp; wealth  Also, I do have to separate myself from the messianic collapse groupies.  I think it's incorrect to view these obvious socialtal difficulties and challenges as insurmountable, as evidence for devine retribution or as replacements for a mythical savior who will punish the wicked and aid the righteous.  Sure post expansion lifestyles might lower than prior generations and in some cases much lower (particularly in energy consumption) but Mad Max probably isn't in our future.

A collapse of our economic model may seem like the collapse of humanity to many, especially first-worlders, but it would not be.

You are correct in that we need to move forward to x, but that means moving forward beyond money. We are as resistant to change as we are adept at it, which is why I do not think we will be willing to discard capitalism as a concept until it has completely failed. I mean, look at the extent of the failures of the church and bible, yet millions still cling to them.

Every problem we currently face can be traced back to capitalism as the root cause. For example, we produce enough food to feed the world twice over and only money prevents us from doing so.

We need to transcend capitalism, not go back to anything, but built a better, new system that precludes the problems and inequalities that capitalism not only gives rise to, but neccessitates.

A capitalism cannot work if everyone is satisfied, if everyone had everything they wanted there would be no trade, the very premise depends on one person having what another wants. Which means there is absolutely no way for a capitalism to satisfy everyone. And any system fundamentally incapable of seeing to everyone's needs needs to be discarded by everyone.",2,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

Thought I would try here instead.",2011-10-22 14:24:20,obama,t3_lkecn,"Hey Stormy. The problem isn't money per se but *usury*. There are systems of money without usury, called [demurrage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_%28currency%29) systems. Basically, instead of money *gaining* value over time (interest), money *loses* value over time.

The impetus is therefore not to hold money as wealth but to circulate it for real goods (that unused food you mentioned, for instance). Obviously, if my paper money is rapidly losing value I want to get it off my hands and pay someone to make something or do something that's actually valuable in the real, non-money sense.

Money's just a very useful means of exchange, and as you've discovered, it's far older than capitalism. It's not going away.  The problem is currency monopolies (actually a form of socialism), which prevent people from experimenting with new forms of money like this. For instance, demurrage currencies were tried in a few German towns during the great depression. Basically, they were too successful and the state realized they'd spread so they were shut down. It's also what the first currencies in Europe at the end of the medieval era were like, because they were just credits for grain you were storing at the community silo. You'd lose some of the grain every year to rats or rot or whatever so the currency would devalue over time to account for that. Douglas Rushkoff explores the development of currency monopolies in his book [*Life Inc*](http://www.rushkoff.com/life-inc/) which I think you'd be interested in.

There's a reason many world religions have (often forgotten) ancient prohibitions on usury. It's reeeally socially destructive.

Just to be clear, the conversation in which I so offended you was one in which you claimed that there's no such thing as nonviolent resistance to violence. Can you elaborate, or better yet, quote my hostility and unreasonableness? I made it very clear that I considered your argument dangerous. *You* started up with the ad hominem nonsense, saying you couldn't keep up with stupidity and I wasn't reading your comments carefully etc. I never stoop that low. You can always tell who's losing the argument because they go there first.

EDIT: Because I don't like being slandered as ""hostile and unreasonable,"" I'll post mine and Stormy's pm conversations:

&gt;[-] to Stormy_Fairweather sent 2 days ago
good talk. Some tips on how to be more convincing in the future:
-edits about not caring about downvotes are a dead giveaway that you care about them -anyone who refers to their position as ""fairly complex"" has a very simple position -you were using false dichotomies, in that a spectrum of violence exists, and humans often have more options than fight or flight, fight or die, etc -red herrings like Gandhi's sex life aren't strong arguments -describing your ""gift"" to see paradoxes is silly in general and amusing in the context of this conversation because your view is so one-sided -never actually engaging in the points your discussion partner's making (like the fact that nonviolence has sometimes worked) makes you seem pigheaded
hope these help!

If it was a good talk I would not have stopped until one of us changed their positions.
I didn't say I didn't care about downvotes, I said what they mean to me and with that understanding I do not mind them.
Sometimes when someone says something it is true, even if it is a self appraisal on the complexity of thier positions.
I was not using false dichotomies, I suspect you didn't follow that link I provided either. You are not familiar with the term, or at least not as much as you think.
Having more variations of our flight or fight response does not change the nature of such responses; words can be a weapon, and can be used in a fight, although not against one wielding violence.
I was not using the red herring, you were using an appeal to authority. I was seeking to point out the flaws of that without using such blanket terms.
If you see my arguments as one sided you missed half; there is a reason I said I sympathize with your position.
You had few points, and they were defeated. That you don't see that makes you seem pigheaded.
I think your views need far more help than me.
I have zero inclinination to deal with you, as you are, further. If I see you make a comment that seems worth engaging I will probably do so (as I will likely forget your name in a few minutes), and I hope your philosophies continue to evolve, as mine certainly will. But that said, if you pm again, especially on the heels of an exchange of the sort we just had I will simply block you.
Have a good one.

bad form, man Especially to publicly admit you've blocked me (shows everybody you can't hack it)! I haven't said anything inflammatory, just stridently and cogently disagreed with you. The fact that you can't handle that should be cause for self-reflection, but that same fact means of course it won't be.
Also, one last note, it's unhelpful to project contradictions in your own thinking as paradoxes in the world. Resolve them instead! I know it's hard work.

It's not just Michigan that's looking bad - it's everywhere - and everyone knows that.

&gt; It has to do with where you chose to live and the career you picked.

Many of these people ""picked"" their careers _decades_ before this happened. 

Let's take a friend of mine - he was a financial manager in a small but profitable group of companies.  The recession hit - receipts crumbled - the owner consolidated everything in another city.

My friend's job simply vanished.  The owner gave him almost a year severance and one of the most astonishingly positive recommendations I ever saw, basically saying he wished he'd ended up with my friend rather than the younger, cheaper, dumber guy he'd had to stick with in the other city (because there had been serious fuckups costing hundreds of thousands, we found out...)

It's been almost two years, and my friend still hasn't found anything except a few contract gigs (some for his old company!) - why?  Because he's almost 60 years old, and because there are 25-year olds with apparently similar credentials who are willing to do a crappy job at the same thing for $30K.

I know a lot of unemployed people - a few of them are just idiots, most of them are smart, thoughtful people who planned their careers with the best information they could get at the time and did very well for many years.

Worse, I know a lot of underemployed people, really smart people who aren't getting enough work to quite make ends meet.  

But it's pointless to discuss this - I assume that until _your_ job goes away, you're going to be able to write off anything bad that happens to other people as ""bad choices"".

False witnesses


In my past life as an evangelical for social action, I had a much-photocopied dossier in my desk drawer from the Procter &amp; Gamble corporation. This surreal document was the company's sadly necessary response to the urban legend that the manufacturer of Tide, Crest and Dawn was some kind of satanic cult.
Briefly, the idea was that the CEO of P&amp;G had at some vague point in the recent past appeared on some talk show -- Phil Donahue, or Sally Jesse, or Oprah, the story mutated and adapted over time -- and declared that he was a Satanist and that a portion of the company's profits were donated regularly to the Church of Satan. (If you're not familiar with it, Snopes has a good rundown of the history of this sordid, stupid lie.)


This is a mind-bogglingly silly story. It's not just implausible, but inconceivable, impossible. It is unbelievable on its face for dozens of reasons that become clear from even a moment's consideration, and it's based on factual claims that are easy to check on and quickly disproved. But we don't need to get bogged down here in the ridiculousness of this malicious rumor, so bracket that for now, that's not the interesting part.

Procter &amp; Gamble had prepared the dossier to combat this zombie rumor. The company had put together its own documents disproving the story and disavowing any connection to the Evil One or to his church. They had collected letters from Donahue, Sally Jesse, Oprah and several other talk show hosts attesting that no one from the company had ever appeared on their programs, much less attempted to use such an appearance to spread the unholy gospel of Satanism. P&amp;G had also collected an impressive array of letters from religious leaders -- the archbishop of Cincinnati, Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell, among others -- all of whom urged their followers not to believe this stupid, stupid lie.
In retrospect, this desperate, shotgun appeal to religious authority demonstrated why the dossier itself was probably futile. It was an acknowledgment that the people they were attempting to convince were beyond the reach of mere fact or reason -- people who did not find reality compelling. The only hope of persuading them, then, was to call upon religious leaders from across the spectrum in the hopes that the pronouncement of one of these random bishops and evangelical pseudo-bishops might be regarded as trustworthy.

If you're forced to resort to such an attempt then you've got to realize that it's not likely to work either. Any audience so far gone as to require this sort of argument is also likely to have already adopted the mechanisms of self-reinforcing stupidity. Thus if they read that Billy Graham denies the rumor, their response won't be ""Oh, OK, Billy Graham. I trust him,"" but rather ""OMG! Billy Graham is in on it too!"" (cf. ""biased media"")
So the dossier was hopeless, but I had yet to come to see that. Thus whenever I came across some group of evangelicals choosing to believe this rumor and spreading it to others, I would photocopy the dossier and send it to them in the hope that good information would correct their misinformation.

That was an old-school, pre-Internet method of doing something that I'm sure everyone reading this used to do via e-mail. You would receive one of those chain e-mails from a parent, friend or coworker, containing some breathless warning against a nonexistent threat. It'd take you a handful of clicks to find the Snopes page debunking the rumor and you would cut and paste the URL back into the e-mail and then hit reply-all.

I say this is something you probably used to do because, I'm guessing, you eventually realized that this approach doesn't work. It didn't work for me either when I sent out those photocopies of that slam-dunk, undeniable dossier from Procter &amp; Gamble.
The dossier/Snopes approach doesn't work because it attempts to apply facts and reason to people who are not interested in either facts or reason. That's not a nice thing to say, or even to think, about anyone else, which is why I was reluctant and slow to reach that conclusion. But that conclusion was inevitable.

In trying to combat the P&amp;G slander with nothing more than irrefutable facts proving it false, I was operating under a set of false assumptions. Among these:

* I assumed that the people who claimed to believe that Procter &amp; Gamble supported the Church of Satan really did believe such a thing.
* I assumed that they were passing on this rumor in good faith -- that they were misinforming others only because they had, themselves, been misinformed.
* I assumed that they would respect, or care about, or at least be willing to consider, the actual facts of the matter.
* Because the people spreading this rumor claimed to be horrified/angry about its allegations, I assumed that they would be happy/relieved to learn that these allegations were, indisputably, not true.

All of those assumptions proved to be false. All of them. This was at first bewildering, then disappointing, and then, the more I thought about it, appalling -- so appalling that I was reluctant to accept that it could really be the case.
But it is the case. Let's go through that list again. The following are all true of the people spreading the Procter &amp; Gamble rumor:

* They didn't really believe it themselves.
* They were passing it along with the intent of misinforming others. Deliberately.
* They did not respect, or care about, the actual facts of the matter, except to the extent that they viewed such facts with hostility.
* Being told that the Bad Thing they were purportedly upset about wasn't real only made them more upset. Proof that the 23rd largest corporation in America was not in league with the Devil made them defensive and very, very angry.

Again, I'm not happy to be saying such things about anyone, and I'm only doing so here reluctantly, yet this is the appalling truth.

Maybe you're also a bit reluctant to accept this. Maybe you're thinking Hanlon's/Heinlein's Razor should apply -- the axiom that reminds us to ""Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.""

I wish that applied here. As I said above, I spent a long time distributing that dossier on that assumption that I was, in fact, dealing with stupidity rather than malice. But the spreading of this rumor cannot be adequately explained by stupidity. Stupidity alone doesn't make one hostile to irrefutable facts. Stupidity cannot account for their vicious anger when the rumor is debunked -- anger at the person doing the debunking, and anger at the whole world for not turning out to be the nightmare they wanted it to be.
But in any case, no one is stupid enough to really believe such a story. The coworkers or relatives who fill your inbox with urban legends and hoaxes may not be the sharpest tools in the shed, but none of them is stupid enough to believe this. And neither are those people who claim that they do believe it.

Go back and unbracket all of the implausibilities and impossibilities of this story. It just makes no sense. Why would a member of a secret evil society of evil go on national TV to tell the world about it? And why would this proudly evil company now deny the very same thing? Why does the name of the TV host keep changing while the CEO himself is never named? And how come no one can seem to find anyone who actually sawthis alleged broadcast? And ...

And why are we even bothering to discuss the holes in this story? It's nothing but holes. Any one of those holes should stop the hearer short, preventing them from passing this ridiculous story along and adding their approval to it.

If a person is smart enough to comprehend this story and then to repeat it, then that person is, by definition, not stupid enough to really believe it.
I used to believe that maybe some people were that stupid. They were acting that stupid, so I went along. I believed that the people I was sending that dossier to were merely innocent dupes.

But in truth they were neither innocent nor dupes. The category of innocent dupe does not apply here. No one could be honestly misled by such a story. The only way to have been misled by it is dishonestly -- which is to say deliberately, willingly and willfully. They are claiming to believe a foolish thing, but they are not guilty of foolishness. They are guilty of malice.

*They are just plain guilty.*

But I'm posting this one because I believe the white house might actually stand up and notice this one if we get behind it. It's not just a petition, it's a pledge to protect America's freedom by fighting the re-election of Barack Obama, or any other president who will not stand up for the basic freedoms every Citizen in this country has a right to.
If you have not heard of the 2012 Defense Authorization Act, then I urge you to read up on it. I believe you'll find that it stands to strip our 4th Amendment rights by allowing the government to arrest and imprison US Citizens without charge indefinitely. Obama has backed down on his threat to veto the bill, and we now face a future without a bill of rights.

 * Obama ended the war in Iraq that Bush started.  If you remember the campaign, McCain said he thought America should stay in Iraq 50, 75, 100 years if needed.  All of the GOP candidates excoriated Obama's Iraq war ending policies.  I think this is a telling example.

 * Just yesterday, Sebelius announced that this year alone over 2.4 million more people will have health insurance as a result of the Obama health care initiative, and that number will grow quickly over the next two-ish years.  Another huge example.  Bush and his henchmen fought just as hard to disinclude people from heath care, and every stinking one of the GOP candidates say that, if in office, they would sign an executive order on their first day to end ""Obama Care.""


I'll grant you that Obama and the Democrats aren't as effective as they should be, but the alternatives are simply draconian.  Frustrated as we are with the pace of progress, we'll do the US a great disservice if we allow the GOP any further measure of control.

Yup. Because we have the GOP intentionally undermining and destroying with great relish any facet of government they can, whether it follows Reagan's philosophy or not but especially if it doesn't. Any good substantive policy is automatically undermined by them. So the Democrats, because they actually care about governing, have been forced to operate at this lowest common denominator and TBH things like ACA aren't that bad considering the alternative.

This while the antiwar protesters were ramping up big time:  Nixon tried to deport John Lennon and let's not forget Kent State.

If you are then suggesting that McCain's message about staying in Iraq for up to 100 years was a marketing message, then I'll submit that it may have been such for the current military industrial complex.  McCain voiced his opinion frequently and vociferously about a pernicious American presence in Iraq.  It wasn't Mad Men advertising:  It was John McCain making a promise to the hawks that he would commit America to continue a war of occupation for as long as he felt like it.  This was the beginning of his downfall in the campaign.


Now, let's face it:  President Obama is simply acting in roll of the lead administrator in the executive branch of the US government.  Unlike Bush, he isn't assuming powers that are prescribed to his office by the Constitution.


Since Bush gave us a couple of wars of convenience to deal with, Obama is also a Commander in Chief.  Even still, there are Consti-fucking-tutional limits to his powers.

I didn't have grand illusions.  I simply expected him to do what he said he would do with regard to open government, lobbyists, secrecy laws, constitutional governance, whistleblowers, the internet, bank regulations, and civil liberties.

On all of these matters, his Administration has worked tirelessly to move our government in the wrong direction.  It is absolutely stunning what they have done after riding a wave of progressive energy to the White House.

In 2008 the Bush administration was negotiating with Iraq for an agreement which they hoped would extend the US stay.  Discussions continued through the fall, because the end of the year was the deadline.

Then in November, Barack Obama, who had been campaigning on getting the US out by the end of 2010, won the election.  Knowing that the next president of the US wanted out in two years made the fight the Bush people were having with Iraq pointless.  Iraq stood their ground and the Americans backed down, and they signed an agreement saying out by the end of 2011.

Then once Obama actually got into office, military leaders talked him into extending his deadline from end of 2010 to end of 2011.  He also tried to renegotiate with Iraq to allow a very small US military presence in Iraq past 2011, but any change to the agreement already signed would've had to be made by the new Iraqi government, which is too splintered to be able to pass anything whatsoever.  The agreement was locked in, even if Iraqi leaders wanted to change it (which they didn't).

So, this is a rare case of a president being effectively locked into abiding by his own campaign promise, *because* he promised it on the campaign.  But, it was Obama's campaign promise that did it.

&gt; Lets also ignore the fact that Obama STARTED the war with Libya.

False.  Ghadafi started the war in Libya.  Obama kickstarted an international response that ended the war - without it, Libya would've probably devolved into low-level guerilla war for a long time, after Ghadafi's military beat the revolutionaries out of the major cities.

&gt; So now that you admit Libya was a war, we can officially impeach Obama for violating the war powers act which REQUIRES congressional approval before we can start a war with another country.

Except that in Libya, the US participated in a limited way in support of a NATO action authorized by the UN.  We've signed treaties, ratified by Congress, that codify obligations we have to those organizations, and it's very reasonable to argue that we don't need a separate declaration of war for something like this.  Certainly less so than our leadership of the NATO war in Kosovo, and even that IMO was an ambiguous case.

What *wasn't* ambiguous was our unilateral invasion of Iraq.  That certainly should've required a declaration of war.",10,[],[],['Barack Obama']

""It was a mistake to have been engaged with him [Antoin Rezko] at all in this or any other personal business dealing that would allow him, or anyone else, to believe that he had done me a favor"" -- Barack Obama

""There's no doubt that this was a mistake on my part. 'Boneheaded' would be accurate. There's no doubt I should have seen some red flags in terms of me purchasing a piece of property from him."" - Barack Obama

""I think very highly of Hillary. The more I get to know her, the more I admire her. I think she's one of the most disciplined people I know. She's one of the toughest. She's got an extraordinary intelligence, and she's somebody who's in this stuff for the right reasons. She's passionate about moving the country forward on issues like health care and children."" -- Barack Obama



**Cocaine**

Long before he ever ran for political office, Obama wrote a book about, well, himself, and his amazing his journey from messed up kid to, um, himself. It was quite an epic, considering he was 34 at the time.

In that book, called ""Dreams From My Father"", he writes that he used marijuana and cocaine (""maybe a little blow"".) Oddly enough, he writes that he didn't try heroin because -- wait for it -- he didn't like the pusher who was selling it. (Weren't there any other reasons?) In a later interview, he added ""Teenage boys are frequently confused.""

But cocaine aside, the press has ignored the one truly outrageous drug scandal that Obama has successfully hid -- he's a SMOKER. That's right, tobacco cigarettes. Obama theoretically gave it up, and claims he never smoked more than 7 or 8 cigarettes a day, but if you dig deeper, he admits he has been bumming cigarettes during the campaign.

**Tony Rezko &amp; the Shady Land Deal**

Barack Obama has been friends with Antoin (""Tony"") Rezko since at least 1990. Barack interviewed with Rezko for a job in the early 1990s (offered, but declined), and has raised at least $150,000 for Obama's campaigns. Prosecutors charge that at least $10,000 of the money Rezko gave Obama was extorted in return for political favors by a different politician. In return, Barack arranged an internship in 2005 for John Aramanda, the son of a Rezko business associate (Joseph Aramanda, who himself gave Barack $11,500.)

There's more. In June, 2005, Obama bought a house in Chicago for $1.65 million ($300,000 below the asking price). The same day, Rezko bought (in his wife's name) the vacant lot next door for $625,000, the full price asked. Seven months later, Rezko sold Barack a slice (1/6th) of his lot so the Obamas could have a bigger yard. There's no evidence that Rezko bought the vacant land for any other reason than to do Obama a favor. The seller would only sell the house if he could sell the lot on the same day. And the lot is only accessible through Obama's yard. Rezko and his wife sold the lot last year to someone they owed money to, and let that person keep the small profit he made.

Here's the real problem: among other problems, Rezko was convicted in a federal government corruption case for demanding kickbacks from companies wanting to do business with Illinois Governor Blagojevich, another politician that Rezko has befriended and donated to. (Rezko is also under indictment for shaking down a Hollywood producer for $1.5 million in campaign contributions for Blagojevich. The guy takes care of his political friends.) In fact, Joseph Aramanda is an unindicted co-conspirator in one of the kickback cases.

Obama has admitted that the land deal was a mistake, and donated money donated directly by Rezko to charity. His story has changed, though. When the land deal was first reported, Obama said his only contact with Rezko was asking him if it was a good deal. In February 2008, though, one of Obama's staffers admitted that the candidate walked around the house and lot with Rezko. Rezko has said he bought the lot to help the Obamas expand their backyard.

**Hanging Out with Radical 60s Bomber**

Bill Ayers, the son of a rich utility executive, calls himself a ""small-C communist."" In 1969, he and his wife Bernadette Dohrn helped found the Weathermen (aka the Weather Underground), a radical group that bombed several buildings, killing a police officer and three of their own members. In 1981, an armed robbery of a Brinks truck by Weather Underground members killed two police and a security guard.

By then Ayers and Dohrn has morphed into reasonably respectable professors in Chicago, and weren't involved. But Ayers has no regrets; in 2001 he even wrote ""I don't regret settings bombs. I feel we didn't do enough."" Ayers and Dohrn were never convicted because of illegal wiretaps and other prosecutorial misconduct that got their charges thrown out.

Great scandal, huh? Only problem is that Ayers' links to Obama are not that clear. They live 3 blocks apart in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood, and their kids go to the same school. In 1995, they were both on the board of a charity founded by Walter Annenberg, the billionaire founder of Reader's Digest (not exactly a liberal - he was Nixon's ambassador to Britain). From 2000 to 2002 they were on another board together (the Woods Foundation). Obama praised one of Ayers' many books, in a 1997 newspaper interview. Ayers donated $200 to Obama's 2001 campaign. The biggest link was in 1995, when Ayers and Dohrn hosted a coffee fundraiser, at which State Senator Alice Palmer introduced Obama as her chosen successor as state senator. Obama certainly had no problem with that hosting, though since then he has criticized Ayers' crimes many times as ""detestable"".

The big question is, does this indicate that Obama is a secret radical? I haven't seen any solid evidence beyond this. But I'm all ears -- email me.



Muslim? Educated in Madrassa? Won 't Salute the Flag? Fox News ran a story claiming that Obama had been educated in a madrassa school in Indonesia. If you're not familiar with that term, it's a type of fundamentalist Muslim school, often funded by the extremist Wahabi sect of Islam (with Saudi money) and often very anti-American.

There was only one problem with the story: it was completely false. Yes, Obama had gone to school in Indonesia as a kid; two schools in fact. One was Catholic, the other was a public school, with teachers and kids of various faiths.

The only scandal here is that Fox News ran the story with no facts or reporting backing it up. They simply repeated a story from a highly partisan website, with no effort to check out the school. It's there, still open, and easily visited. Reporters who did so found out that the story was false in minutes.

There have been several other stories about Obama floating around in emails -- that he's secretly Muslin, refuses to put his hand over his heart when saying the pledge of allegiance, that he is secretly Muslim, etc. We print REAL scandals, not fake ones. If you want the facts on these lies, a great source is www.snopes.com.

&gt; The White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has been a refuge for special interests seeking to avoid regulation since the early days of the Reagan Administration. But candidate Barack Obama was clear about his intention to free government from the grip of special interests, make governance transparent, and use the regulatory process to enforce – at last – the nation’s laws protecting health, safety, and the environment.
 
&gt; Nearly three years into the Obama Administration, it has become clear that those laudable objectives are being thwarted: The regulatory process is every bit as political as it was during the Bush years, while being no more transparent; and vigorous enforcement of the nation’s health, safety, and environmental laws has suffered as a result.
 
&gt; Those are among the principal findings of CPR’s detailed study of the work of OIRA, the obscure office that rides herd over the regulatory process from within the White House. According to Behind Closed Doors at the White House: How Politics Trumps Protection of Public Health, Worker Safety and the Environment, by CPR President Rena Steinzor, Policy Analyst James Goodwin, and Intern Michael Patoka, President Obama’s OIRA, under Administrator Cass Sunstein, has pursued an “all you can meet” policy that industry and other special interests are eagerly exploiting. As a result, special interest representatives’ meetings with OIRA’s economists and White House political appointees vastly outnumber OIRA’s meetings with public interest organizations.

In fact heres the searchable database detailing ALL meeting and their end results.

I respect your frustration and disapproval but I want you to consider that NOT voting sends NO message whatsoever. There is, I sincerely believe, a greater danger in demonstrating unwillingness to participate in a democracy, even in one that shows discomforting flaws. 

If I understand you correctly, you suggest that letting things get a little worse may motivate (eventually) the deeper course correction you wish were fully enabled. I do not think we have that luxury anymore. Give President Obama four more years to help undo the very significant damage done to the middle class and to this country as a whole. Barack Obama's methods are working, and I, too, wish our country would get back on track faster than it is. Politics is slow, and pushing against the demands of the rich and unconscionable takes time.

Deep down I am certain President Obama knows the problems in NDAA that offend you, and me. His statement that accompanied his signing demonstrates his awareness. Although the NDAA shoves offensive issues in our faces, it doesn't represent a real departure from previously existing policy. The biggest threat to justice in the United States has been the systematic deprivation of resources for essential institutions, such as Education and Healthcare. If our country awards control to the ideological excesses of right wing or libertarian leaders, those precious institutions will be in extreme danger, precisely because the post-1980 conservative movement has pursued their demise, and all that's needed is one more blow.

",,2012-01-16 01:59:38,obama,t3_oih5i,"Honestly, it's not Obama's policies or legislative priorities and achievements that have disappointed me. I expected serious resistance, and I'm proud of what the president has accomplished with regards to economic, social, and military reforms/actions. I'm willing to accept compromise...even on important issues, if it means the advancement of still greater priorities.

What truly disappoints me, though, is that I'm starting to feel like Obama has failed as a unifying leader. For all his rhetoric about agreeing without being disagreeable and his actions to disavow the negative politics of division in 2008...in office, he gave up this act very early.

In his pursuit of policy achievements, I think he has partially squandered the high-ground. What really inspired me in 2008 was that I finally felt like I was supporting a candidate who was above petty politics. Yes, his goals (and my own) were and still are progressive priorities, but he presented them in a light that made progressive priorities seem like everyone's priorities. Remember how supportive public opinion was of cap-and-trade and Romneycare? Yes, some of that was destined to fade, but I'd argue that Obama made a choice early on (perhaps with Rahm Emanuel's coaxing) to pursue immediate accomplishments over long-term political change.

And that's weakened him, not just in terms of re-election (but note his significantly softer independent support), but it's also weakened the very accomplishments he's already made. In my opinion, PPACA is vulnerable to repeal because Obama allowed petty politics (i.e. Congressional sausage-making) to derail a process of widely-supported reform and turn it into a referendum split straight down ideological lines.

He allowed this to happen again and again too. And he's allowing it to happen now by embracing the 99% theme. I'm all for fighting inequality using progressive methods...but progressive rhetoric is class warfare. Obama, like it or not, has subtly begun to pit Americans against one another. And he's going to get destroyed for it in November. If he doesn't start trying to rekindle the ""rising tide raises all boats theme"" soon, then Mitt Romney's going to be able to present his hypocritical self as the great unifier.

That's what disappoints me.

What disappoints me though, is that in using his political capital, sometimes I feel like Obama also took that as a license to prop up ordinary politics.

Clearly, from a policy standpoint, I'm happy that healthcare and student loan reform got done in reconciliation. Same goes for the spate of recess appointments and using parliamentary maneuvers and back-room deals to avoid lengthy government shutdowns (or even just to raise the debt limit). If these things hadn't transpired, the country would be worse off.

However, in so doing, Obama not only sacrificed political capital (of course people will sour on him as he proposes and enacts policies they dislike/disagree with), but I think that he also sacrificed the core value of his campaign.

That old annoying adage, ""He went to Washington to change Washington, and Washington changed him,"" isn't perfect, but I think that's it's at least fairly relevant here. Obama has accomplished great things, but he did it in the most conventional of ways. A lot of his independent and conservative support in 2008 came from Obama's transcendent politics, not from his ideology. And by neglecting that in favor of legislative victories, he has in a way...put those same victories in jeopardy of full repeal by the vengeful and resurgent Republican party.

Believe me, no one was a bigger Obama supporter from 2007 onward, but maybe this adage would be more apt: ""He went to Washington as Barack Obama, and he governed as Hillary Clinton."" Cold political calculus over inspirational leadership.",1,['Barack Obama'],[],['Barack Obama']

",,2012-01-16 05:54:33,obama,t3_oih5i,"Obama did more to reach out to conservatives in Congress than was necessary. Unlike the last president to try and enact real health care reform, Obama basically told Congress to write the bill themselves. He brought together conservatives, liberals, and the private sector to work on the bill. He didn't present Congress with his own version and just say, ""Pass this or go fuck yourselves.""

In other words, your whole premise is wrong. Obama did *too much* to reach out to the right. Remember, they were in the minority then. Sure, they had filibuster power, but he didn't have to be as magnanimous as he was. I think he paid a price for that politically because Republicans saw it as a sign of weakness. Their reaction was basically, ""Holy shit, he's willing to talk to us? To involve us in the process?! Sweet! Let's call him a fucking socialist fascist asshole and oppose each and every thing he tries to accomplish no matter what.""

Why would they do that? Power. Power simply for power's sake. I truly believe Obama wanted power to enact real change (which he has); most conservatives in Congress want power because 1.) Money 2.) They think they deserve it 3.) They have penis envy. They don't get into politics because they want to lead this country to a brighter future; they get into politics because Power fills a void in their egos.

Obama messed up, I think, by letting the baby have its bottle; his heart was in the right place, but every parent knows that if you give in to a screaming baby's demands each and every time, you end up regretting it. Sometimes you need to just let the baby cry.

I think Obama has learned by now not to do this (great example: the debt ceiling tantrum). But to suggest that it's somehow Obama's fault for not ""unifying"" the country? For not rising above petty politics? For not disagreeing without being disagreeable? That's bullshit. He did those things.

He sat around and twiddled his thumbs for 6 months while Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe played Max Baucus for a fool. He let Snowe, then-Republican Arlen Spector and others pare down a meaningful stimulus bill. The list goes on and on.

I guess what I'm trying to say though, is that I don't have a problem with ""what"" Obama's done. Especially given the opposition he's faced from Republicans, who I agree...are with few exceptions interested in selfish goals. I even think he accomplished as much as he could have accomplished in the current political climate.

What disappoints me is ""how"" he's done it...and what's particularly a bummer to me...is the personal realization that there may have been no other way to do it. Even so, what Obama allowed the Republicans to do is make him look partisan, and thus, ordinary. I think he did this partly by giving Congressional Dems too much freedom to come up with their own solutions. The Cornhusker Kickback, the Louisiana Purchase...these things may have been of small practical importance (and they were eliminated in the reconciliation bill), but they started a trend of slowly discrediting Obama's post-politics approach. They started to reaffirm to people that our bullshit politics weren't going anywhere fast.

Obama led as an administrator, and he's been a great one at that. He's led with honor and decorum and put together a record as a president who gets things done, who appointed serious leaders to important Cabinet posts, who doesn't make gaffes or cause scandals, and who has real principles but is not weighed down by onerous ideology. He will get my vote this November without the slightest hesitation.

But ultimately, I'm not sure Obama was able to lead as the transformative figure I (and many others) believed he could be. He's fallen into a pattern of conventional politics. I don't think all is lost, but what I'd like to see next Tuesday night is an Obama who presents himself to the nation as the hopeful and unifying figure he campaigned as. I don't want to seem him the drop the criticism of inequality, but I don't want to hear anything vilifying the top 1%. Independents have no problem hearing the factual state of our union, but class warfare is dangerous territory...even if the stinging rebukes are only delivered by proxy (e.g. Alan Krueger).

To me, Obama's always been at his best when he uses the bully pulpit to take nuanced and fair stances, even if they aren't easy political soundbites.

* Remember how Obama took the Jeremiah Wright brouhaha and without vilifying Wright, gave an emotional speech that turned the entire controversy into an asset to his campaign?

You show your patriotism by being true to our values and ideals. That’s what we have to lead with is our values and our ideals.”

* Or even the oft-parodied Beer Summit? He took a potentially explosive and divisive issue and completely defused it by pushing for rational discussion over demagoguery.

* Or how after getting pummeled in the 2010 elections, he held an honest press conference without partisan spin where he admitted that the economy wasn't as great as touted and took responsibility?

Is this a joke? Bush's Wall St Bailouts had public support of say 20% across both parties, and yet Obama continued it anyway and at Wall St it's business as usual. What about the TSA? That also has extremely low public support in both parties. To add insult to injury, it doesn't even make us more secure. Again what does he do but double down on pretty much almost every program his predecessor has started.

&gt; Would McCain be instituting fracking regulations?

O you mean the big money give away also known as the bank bailout for the health care industry?

&gt; Would McCain have stepped back and opposed SOPA? 

The Obama admin hasn't officially said that they oppose SOPA or PIPA. They said that they oppose something that they 'felt' would undermine our rights. With politics that could mean anything, and the fix could be mean anything including adding one or two minor changes to those laws. Unless they publicly say straight out that SOPA and PIPA are bad, it's just empty words for election year.

Hedges is right. Obama is just someone who likes to pretend to be a liberal.

&gt; Did you actually listen to him? 

Yes I did. What he says almost always sounds great. His actions on the other hand have not always been nice, nor do they match what he preaches most of the time.

For some reason, without some sort of sufficient evidence to the contrary, I just cannot see the Obama administration doing that kind of shit. And Obama did try to shut it down, Congress stopped it. This is straight from wikipedia: 

On January 22, 2009, the White House announced that President Barack Obama had signed an order to suspend the proceedings of the Guantanamo military commission for 120 days and that the detention facility would be shut down within the year.[9][10] On January 29, 2009, a military judge at Guantanamo rejected the White House request in the case of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, creating an unexpected challenge for the administration as it reviews how America puts Guantanamo detainees on trial.[11] On May 20, 2009, the United States Senate passed an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009 (H.R. 2346) by a 90-6 vote to block funds needed for the transfer or release of prisoners held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[12]

From the early 90's and on, the government stopped helping with higher education and it had to be financed through loans only. Once the government stopped subsidizing education, the price of education went through the roof. 

I  graduated High school in 1986. I graduated college and left with no debt. (I worked during school.) A few friends left with 10 thousand dollars in debt. Their parents were rich, and that seemed like a lot.

Now, you can't leave school with out nearly 100K in debt, which would be cool, except most jobs don't 100K. 

Most people I know, except for those that have parents who are really well off, will spend most of their 20s really poor and paying off student loans.

Jeb Bush has also played a critical role in the GOP presidential primary contest in Florida -- primarily by saying he wouldn't play a role.

&gt;No more bailouts?? he NEVER said that.

You're right, I remembered it wrong.  What I remembered was the part where he promised to cap the bonuses of the companies benefiting from taxpayer money at $500,000, which he later retracted.

&gt;He also never claimed he'd do anything about the drug war.

&gt;I don't know where you got all of that, but it certainly wasn't from Obama.

&gt;It makes me curious as to what you don't know about Ron Paul. 

It makes me curious how much you have misconstrued about Ron Paul.

&gt;and he wants to let corporations pay off politicians?

Source?

&gt;Did you know he wants to get rid of the 14th amendment (the civil rights one)?

He wants to repeal the 14th amendment because it grants amnesty to illegal immigrants' children who are born here then are entitled to all of our programs for our Citizens.  That provides incentive for them to sneak into our country illegally and produce anchor babies.

&gt;Oh, one more thing. Campaign anyone and president anyone are two different people. Never in the history of the United States has a president accomplished 100% of what they set out to do (Polk was probably the closest, but that was a loooooong time ago). 

This is true, but when someone is deceitful, like saying ""we ought to rethink the war on drugs"", then have an ""online hang out open forum"" where internet users can ask questions and ignore the top rated questions about drug policies because it's ""inappropriate"" is misleading and immature.  Signing the NDAA is disgusting.  Assassinating US Citizens without trial is disgusting.  Signing ACTA is and claiming it doesn't need to be ratified is appalling.  

&gt;You're dreaming if you think Ron Paul can actually do what he says he'd do. 

I know he won't be able to do everything he wants to do, and that's fine.  The biggest looming problem for our country is the amount of reckless spending in Federal Government.  He is the only one who will cut spending.  THE ONLY ONE.  I don't know the process for closing the departments he wants to, but he will however be able to cut a ton of military spending by immediately bringing our troops home.  ",5,[],['Barack Obama'],[]

Knowing which is which sounds like a matter of faith. 

&gt;most important issue to American people is the economy and the deficit.

Dems ask for something that makes him a heretic to Republicans like a tax increase or some expansion of the safety net. Republicans will ask for some union-busting stuff or a ban on condoms or something that the Dems will never accept. Now both sides can blame each other, and when nothing gets passed the people do what they do: blame the President. 

There's also a difference between supporting ""cuts"" generically and getting behind specific cuts or the elimination of specific departments. People will speak glowingly of reducing the size of government until they realize it's going to affect them, too.

&gt;Commander in Chief means he controls the Army, he doesn't need Congress' approval to bring them home. 
 
I know. I was referring to, and thinking you meant, closing the ""Departments"" of the various armed services, [ie these guys.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Navy) Along with Congress itself (ie. that jetfighter nonsense a couple years back) the DoD and its appendages on the civilian side are where the money gets thrown around.

If you were referring to, ie. closing the Department of Education then he'd need approval for that as well.
 
&gt;You're an idiot if you think it costs the same amount to have 900 bases around the world as it does to secure the borders of the US.

I thought you were just talking about bringing home the Iraq &amp; Afghanistan troops. The ""900 bases"" thing is [heavily fudged.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-us-has-military-personnel-130-nation/)

&gt;For instance, the sole site listed for Canada is 144 square feet of leased space -- equal to a 12-foot-by-12-foot room. That’s an extreme case, but other nations on the list -- such as Aruba, Iceland, Indonesia, Kenya, Norway and Peru -- have just a few U.S. military buildings, many of them leased. Some of the sites are unmanned radio relay towers or other minor facilities. ""Most of them are a couple of acres with a cyclone fence and no troops,"" Pike said.

Ron Paul says 900 bases, Politifact can verify 662 and says he might be right about the total. Of the 662, the cheapest 630 could be demolished and rebuilt from scratch for $576 billion *tops.* (It's given as ""replacement value of $915 million or less."" I doubt that 12x12 room costs $915 million but who knows.)

Now here's my point: Ron Paul isn't giving us dollar figures. He's scaring us big spooky numbers. 900 military bases (or relay towers, or utility closets, or whatever). I don't know what the total cost of all those bases is, nor do I know how much it would cost to militarize the border, and I suspect you don't either since you brought it up in these terms. I know it makes me suspicioous that he's throwing around the fudged base-count figure instead of giving me a dollar amount. I know the border is almost 2,000 miles long so it isn't going to be remotely cheap.",2,[],['Barack Obama'],[]

Obama lied.  Refer to my previous posts in this thread.

&gt;Dems ask for something that makes him a heretic to Republicans like a tax increase or some expansion of the safety net. Republicans will ask for some union-busting stuff or a ban on condoms or something that the Dems will never accept. 

Right.  This is why Ron Paul says, it's not a matter of compromise, it's building coalitions.  If you believe in individual freedom and less government that is something you can attract people from both sides.  The budget needs to be cut, that's the bottom line.  1 in 5 Americans depend on the Government today.  We're turning into a socialist country, and will end up similar to how the Soviets did, why can't you see that?

&gt;There's also a difference between supporting ""cuts"" generically and getting behind specific cuts or the elimination of specific departments. People will speak glowingly of reducing the size of government until they realize it's going to affect them, too.

Yes that is part of the problem.  Everyone in this country thinks they are entitled to things like cellphones and ""affordable"" education.  People are confusing rights and entitlements and need to reevaluate what the role of the federal government should be.  

&gt;I know. I was referring to, and thinking you meant, closing the ""Departments"" of the various armed services, [1] ie these guys.

When did Ron Paul say he wants to close the Department of the Navy?

&gt;If you were referring to, ie. closing the Department of Education then he'd need approval for that as well.

Yes that is what I was talking about.  He needs to convince the general public about closing those departments, and I know he can do it.  His ability to explain them allows everyone to grasp why closing the department of education isn't hurting schools, but enhancing them.  

&gt;Now here's my point: Ron Paul isn't giving us dollar figures. He's scaring us big spooky numbers. 900 military bases (or relay towers, or utility closets, or whatever). I don't know what the total cost of all those bases is, nor do I know how much it would cost to militarize the border, and I suspect you don't either since you brought it up in these terms. I know it makes me suspicioous that he's throwing around the fudged base-count figure instead of giving me a dollar amount. I know the border is almost 2,000 miles long so it isn't going to be remotely cheap.

From that link you posted - ""According to this report, the U.S. has 662 overseas bases in 38 foreign countries, which is a smaller number than the 900 bases Paul cited. But here again, the list omits several nations integral to active operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so it’s conceivable that the actual number of sites approaches 900.""

I am interested how much it costs to operate and maintain all the bases and forces we have throughout the world too.  Just owning and upkeep of the places, all the money that our soldiers end up spending overseas, the lives lost, it's probably a lot.  But another thing to think of is the reason we are there.  How can you justify having troops in Germany, South Korea, Australia, etc?  ",0,[],['Barack Obama'],[]

Of course he did. They all do. I'm talking Paul: how do you know he's not yanking your chain right now? He has a long consistent record of... saying things. He has no legislative record. It becomes a matter of trust and personality, similar to what Obama built up in '08 and Bush before him. When you're saying you're ok with Paul falling short before he becomes President and before we know how or why he falls short, you're in a bad position. You don't want to go trusting any politician to that degree.

&gt;coalition building ... freedom ... 1 in 5 ... cellphones ... etc

I'm talking pure cynical politics. I don't agree with Ron Paul's politics, but that isn't the point. None of that has anything to do with how Ron Paul will convince Congress to do what he wants without severely compromising himself.

&gt;We're turning into a socialist country, and will end up similar to how the Soviets did, why can't you see that?

Yeah this isn't hyperbolic at all.

&gt;&gt;I was referring to, and thinking you meant, closing the ""Departments""

&gt;When did Ron Paul say he wants to close the Department of the Navy?

I was confused about what you meant, that's all.

&gt;He needs to convince the general public about closing those departments, and I know he can do it.

Well, he'll have to convince the Republican primary voters first. They're a more receptive audience and they aren't buying it. I can't say as I like his chances.

&gt;Just owning and upkeep of the places, all the money that our soldiers end up spending overseas, the lives lost, it's probably a lot.

Yeah I really don't know. They give that replacement value figure, so I'm assuming it costs less to maintain these places than it would to demolish and rebuild them from scratch. There are some breakdowns on Wikipedia under United States Military Budget but they're really high level. One figure was like $700 billion for ""base budget and contingency operations,"" but I'm pretty sure that's taken to mean 'basis' rather than 'military base.' 

Looks like there might be more detailed info [here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals/) but Excel is fully not my thing. So.

&gt; But another thing to think of is the reason we are there. How can you justify having troops in Germany, South Korea, Australia, etc? 

One of these things is not like the other. South Korea is an important trade partner - we get all kinds of electronics and other doodads from there - and we have treaties and such with them, which isn't unique - but then there's the neighbor to the North, and more significantly, the bigass country to the north of them. We don't want them getting overrun. I know Paul gives no fucks about most of that, but we're in similar situations with a lot of the countries that get mentioned in this sense, either through NATO or as [MNNAs.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_non-NATO_ally) 

It's not all like ""oh world police!"" or whatever as it's portrayed. There's some of that, but mainly it's cynical. We do it because it benefits us more than it costs, generally through trade. It's all give and take, and we can't go telling too many of these countries to piss off before they figure out what's up and go jiggle China or Russia's balls instead.

Sure, but he's been in the House. That gives him the luxury of knowing that the chance he'll ever be the deciding factor is basically zero. As President he can't just start vetoing everything. He's shown a willingness to bilk his fans in the past - most notably with the newsletter stuff - and I disagree that he won't give you the runaround. When he talks about his positions on federal stuff - gay marriage, surveillance, whatever - he's pretty good at talking around the fact that he's fine with it being done at the state level.

&gt;What about his policies don't you agree with? 

Pretty much everything, and more importantly the reasoning he uses to come to those conclusions. There are lots of his positions I'd agree on if he wasn't ok with the states doing it, and then a lot of others that are just flat-out disgusting like the Civil Rights Act/14th amendment stuff being wrongly decided and so forth. And his economic and regulatory ideas are a flat-out fantasy.

&gt;Explain how is our debt and deficit sustainable without cutting spending.

I was responding to the part I quoted, which was a patently ridiculous statement about America becoming a socialist Soviet state. But since you asked, we basically just keep borrowing money. We're the world's reserve currency and with what's going on with the Euro lately that position is getting even more solidified. People have been screaming about looming hyperinflation for years now, yet folks who buy bonds for a living are still willing to give us their money at rates so low they work out to a zero real interest rate. Our debt might start to cause a problem someday, but there would be indications and it wouldn't happen overnight.

In the meantime we can do some tweaks like raising taxes, eliminating carried interest and so forth and gradually bring the debt down. Or we can come in, cut a trillion dollars immediately, and throw tens or hundreds of thousands more people onto the unemployment line when the economy is barely showing signs of life. 

&gt;His support has grown tremendously since 2008

From nothing to last or next-to-last in all but a couple contests. You have to consider how much weaker the GOP field is this time too: Huckabee/Romney/McCain/Paul vs. Gingrich/Romney/Santorum/Paul. 

&gt;and it doesn't help when the media completely ignores him, distorts his views, and demeans him nonstop.

Some of the crazy shit he's said on civil rights, his acceptance of Neo-Nazi donations and so forth has damaged him beyond repair on whatever things he does make sense on. I know that you guys have explanations handy for all that stuff, but you have to realize how ridiculous they sound to the rest of us. Nobody made Paul say that you should be able to kick a black guy out of your place of business, and if people hear he said that and think he's crazy as a result that's his own damn fault. If he wants to defend that on principle that's his right, but again, he shouldn't get pissed when people think it makes him a crazy old racist.

&gt;Is $700 billion not a lot of money these days?

$700 billion as the [BASIS](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/basis)  + contingency budget for the **entire military**. Not for bases. Read.

That gives him the luxury of knowing that the chance he'll ever be the deciding factor is basically zero. As President he can't just start vetoing everything. 

Why not?  Grover Cleveland vetoed 414 times, with 1% override rate in his first term.  Franklin Roosevelt vetoed 635 times with an override of 1-2%.  Presidential vetoes are good, because that means more of congress has to agree to make it law.

He's shown a willingness to bilk his fans in the past - most notably with the newsletter stuff - and I disagree that he won't give you the runaround.

He rails against the TSA without mentioning that he's fine with the same function being served by a private outfit. 

Gay marriage he's fine with state's deciding how they want to handle it because its not a position you can blanket the whole country with.  If your state doesn't allow gay marriage and you're gay, either fight to change the law where you live or move.  With regards to surveillance I have never asked that specific question to him if he thinks states should be allowed to, but even so, state governments are much more accountable to their constituents.  The TSA is ok if it's a private institution because it's the will of the companies to do it.  Right now it's being forced on the airlines and they have no say.  The airlines have to pay for it, and the TSA dictates how they run their business.

&gt;Pretty much everything, and more importantly the reasoning he uses to come to those conclusions.

And his economic and regulatory ideas are a flat-out fantasy.

The 14th amendment allows illegal immigrants to sneak across the border and produce anchor babies.  It is a great way to get rid of the incentive for them to come here illegally.  As far as the civil rights portion of the 14th, I think I agree that it should stay in tact, but I haven't heard him argue against that portion of it.  

**What positions are you not ok with the states handling that aren't already being handled at a federal level?**

&gt;And his economic and regulatory ideas are a flat-out fantasy.

His economic ideas meaning get rid of the federal reserve and go back to the gold standard?

&gt;But since you asked, we basically just keep borrowing money. We're the world's reserve currency and with what's going on with the Euro lately that position is getting even more solidified. People have been screaming about looming hyperinflation for years now, yet folks who buy bonds for a living are still willing to give us their money at rates so low they work out to a zero real interest rate. Our debt might start to cause a problem someday, but there would be indications and it wouldn't happen overnight.

Do you know what a Fiat currency is, and why it has the ability to hyper-inflate overnight?  Because it's value is based on confidence.  Confidence is not tangible.  Gold is.  The Federal Reserve and the fractional banking system allows for lots of cheap credit which allows the market to expand at an enormous rate, but it also allows massive manipulation.  

&gt;In the meantime we can do some tweaks like raising taxes, eliminating carried interest and so forth and gradually bring the debt down. Or we can come in, cut a trillion dollars immediately, and throw tens or hundreds of thousands more people onto the unemployment line when the economy is barely showing signs of life. 

Are you talking about increase in unemployment because Government workers will be out of a job?

&gt;Some of the crazy shit he's said on civil rights

What ""crazy shit"" besides the news letters that he did not write?

&gt;$700 billion as the [1] BASIS + contingency budget for the entire military. Not for bases. Read.

Right.  And without multiple wars, and all the other costs with patrolling the world that would be significantly reduced.  If that $700 billion was reduced to whatever it costs to pay for each serviceman/woman, and they were spending that money here, then it boosts our economy.

&gt;""the neighbor to the North, and more significantly, the bigass country to the north of them. ""

If we left the region there is a chance China invaded NK, and SK, but that's similar to what happened in the cold war and I think we'd need to have a serious discussion about what to do if that happened.  That is a huge hypothetical scenario though.

&gt;Right. Totally cynical. We dangle a carrot or threaten to hit them with stick and they give us what we want for the benefit of our big media companies. 

What makes you think that the US doesn't pressure other countries into getting what it wants?  And what makes you think our Government is not run by lobbying corporate giants?

I'm not going to explain at length how ridiculous a failure Paul's presidency would be if comes in and immediately vetoes the budget, vetoes continuing resolutions, vetoes military funding, vetoes the Medicare doc fix, vetoes the AMT patch, shuts the government down, etc. etc. etc. should Congress be unwilling to pass extensions on terms that satisfy of his rigid positions. Your example is a guy who was president 120 years ago; if you aren't aware of how much things have changed since then, get so.

&gt;Gay marriage he's fine with state's deciding 

Right. He's fine with gay people being oppressed as long as the state does it.

&gt;either fight to change the law where you live or move

You realize that if Ron Paul got his way gay people will *never* get federal marriage benefits right? Tax exemptions, social security survivor benefits, etc. that straight people get are barred by DOMA's ban on gay marriage at the federal level. Paul has said he would've voted for DOMA if he had the chance. He also pushed legislation that would prevent federal courts from hearing challenges to DOMA (We the People Act &amp; Marriage Protection Act). The only way to get gay people those benefits would be for Congress to repeal DOMA and pass a different law allowing gay marriage federally - which is something Ron Paul is against doing.

As it is, DOMA has been declared unconstitutional in multiple cases already, and the Obama admin agrees and has stopped defending it. It's on the way out for *everyone* sooner rather than later. In a Paul world, once the 16-year process of fighting DOMA (passed 1996) wraps up, all we have to do is pull the same thing off **49 more times** in order to achieve the same result.

&gt;As far as the civil rights portion of the 14th, I think I agree that it should stay in tact, but I haven't heard him argue against that portion of it. 

Ron Paul: Civil Rights Act of 1964 [""undermine\[d\] the concept of liberty"" and ""destroyed the principle of private property and private choices.""](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/01/ron-paul-civil-rights-act_n_1178688.html) This stuff is barely-disguised code for ""you should be able to kick brown people out of your place of establishment.""

&gt;What positions are you not ok with the states handling that aren't already being handled at a federal level?

You want a simple answer? All of them. You aren't going to change my mind. In case you haven't noticed, I'm more familiar with the guy's positions than you are.

&gt;His economic ideas meaning get rid of the federal reserve and go back to the gold standard?

Right. Fantasy.

&gt;What makes you think that the US doesn't pressure other countries into getting what it wants?

Look up ""carrot and stick.""

&gt;Do you know what a Fiat currency is, and why it has the ability to hyper-inflate overnight?

You're not the only person who has read a book. Stuff that gets taught in the first week of a survey-level Poli Sci course isn't the sort of thing you want to be condescending about- I'm not a child. You don't need to ask me if I know what 1+1 is either. As for the rest of the stump speech, I already addressed the stuff you brought up. There would be indications and so forth. I gather from the repetition of talking points that the nuances are a bit lost. 

&gt;Are you talking about increase in unemployment because Government workers will be out of a job?

Duh. Are you suggesting those aren't tens or hundreds of thousands of real people whose money would get pulled out of the economy right when it's starting to wake up? That they wouldn't experience suffering? What is your point here? They aren't an abstraction.

&gt;What ""crazy shit"" besides the news letters that he did not write?

You mean besides the minor, unimportant detail of making millions of dollars pretending to be even more racist than he is? Yeah but that's not a big deal. Let's brush that aside. (As I said: you guys just don't get how ridiculous it is of you to expect that any of us buy these explanations.) How about the Civil Rights Act being a violation of privacy. How about that sexual harassment should be legal. How about We the People and Marriage Protection. That a good start?

&gt;Why would we not be allowed to trade with anyone all of a sudden?

Because a world in which Russia or China don't overtake the the countries we trade with by force only exists because of our military support. You're making assumptions that are glued together by the stuff you want to demolish.

&gt;So I assume you support Obama? 

Why would you do that? And why is it relevant? Ron Paul said that shit about the CRA regardless of who I support, or if I support someone at all.

&gt;What do you think our biggest problems in government are, and how do you fix them?

Money in politics. Religion in politics. Revolving door between lobbying and politics.

The way we fix them is with stricter regulation. We get clean elections by barring outside donations and funding them publicly like most countries do. Ron Paul's answer (let it figure itself out!) makes every one of those worse.",1,[],['Barack Obama'],[]

However, I don't think that married couples should receive federal benefits.  

As unpopular as allowing people to refuse service to people because of their race or religion, I can see the idea behind not outlawing it.  From my understanding, the premise is free speech should be allowed to be exercised in all forms.  On the other hand, I don't think the societal impact of allowing it to be legal would be a good thing.  It would probably divide areas of the country by race or religion, and lots of racial/religious gang violence would occur from it.  This may be an area where Ron Paul's philosophy is too idealistic, but to repeal the 14th amendment, you'd need a super majority of Congress, and I don't think that would realistically happen.  I would be in favor of repealing the first sentence of it though, or amending it to help fix the illegal immigration problem.

The reason I asked if you support Obama is because I'm curious.  We're in [/r/Obama](/r/Obama) so why is that not a legitimate assumption?  

&gt;Money in politics. Religion in politics. Revolving door between lobbying and politics.

I agree with you 100% on all three.  Money in politics is a huge problem.  I agree with you on barring foreign donations but disagree on public funding.  I prefer limits on donations to campaigns and full disclosure, rather than public funding.  But I'm not entirely sure what public funding would look like, so my stance on how to implement it isn't very strong.  What country has this policy?

What are the biggest examples about religion being in politics?  I'm asking because I don't know what they are.  I agree that they should be separate.

The revolving door is a huge problem.  That is why I disagree with our current Foreign Policy so strongly, because it has been crafted and implemented by the same people since the 60's.  The Copyright lobby is prevalent today with SOPA/PIPA/PCIPA/ACTA type shit constantly being crafted in secret and attempted to slip through undetected.

That'd be more consistent then Paul. I don't understand why you'd have an issue with married people getting their deceased spouse's SS survivor benefits, though. That spouse paid FICA fair and square. Their leftover benefits either go to the spouse or back to Treasury.

&gt;free speech should be allowed to be exercised in all forms.

The modern understanding is about Equal Protection (14th amdt.) TL;DR If a place is open to the public then it's open to all of the public except those who might exhibit certain *behaviors.* You can be denied entry to a place because you're drunk, no shirt or shoes, etc. Can't deny entry to groups of black people, gay people, disabled people. Scumbag Ron Paul gets caught slipping: claim to see people as individuals, support group-based discrimination. d:D

&gt;you'd need a super majority of Congress

Or shift the Supreme Court and get new precedent. SCOTUS is already 5-4 conservative; with Paul we'd be 6-3 or even 7-2. The question would be who he could get through, but I'm thinking Scalia at best and somewhere to the right of [Robert Bork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork#Supreme_Court_nomination) if Paul got his way. SC justices tend to sit for at least 20 years, so whatever he did manage to do would be with us for awhile. I'd feel *fairly* confident that not even the Roberts court has the balls to throw the CRA out, but you [never know when they're going to get that activist itch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_united)

&gt;why is that not a legitimate assumption? 

A lot of Paul supporters seem to be pretty new to this stuff and take up whatever argument defends Paul / his positions without understanding how various concepts fit together. I was talking to a Paul supporter yesterday who said the Constitution was ""just a piece of paper written by people,"" or something to that effect, because I was pointing to parts of it that weren't fitting where he wanted to go. That dude was a loon, but generally there's a lot demanding of to know who I support and very little asking what my positions are. The focus for them is more on personality so I did a bit of poking to make sure you weren't That Guy. 

I voted Obama in '08, feel like he did more than the usual amount of letting people down, but it's not a uniquely Obama thing; that's basically what the [modern Democratic party has become.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Leadership_Council#Founding_and_early_history) Democrats for deregulation and other nonsense started in the late 70s under Carter. I live in California, which may as well get it over with and award electoral votes to Obama now. I'm going to vote all the downticket stuff like normal.  For President probably the Greens or maybe Rocky Anderson, who is much closer to what Paul-supporting progressives seem to want/think they're getting, depending on if he manages to build any sort of movement by then.

That said, voting isn't a matter of self-expression. If my vote mattered I would make a strategic choice for Obama because the other option is someone worse; because of the Supreme Court; and because I think the flaws in the modern Democratic party are much easier to push against when there's a Democrat in office. We get another Republican and the Democrats get to go back to pretending that ""opposing the Republicans"" is the same thing as ""supporting progressive causes.""

&gt;What country has this policy?

Off the top of my head I don't remember specifically. The safe assumption is that [all European countries and most South American countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance#Public_financing) do it this way. There are exceptions, of course, and then there are some [hybrids.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_political_financing_in_Canada#Private_funding)

We already have it in a [very limited form.](http://www.fec.gov/info/checkoff.htm) If we expand that program and then set strict caps on how much each candidate gets, we don't need much from each taxpayer and anyone who qualifies is on a level playing field. (And how they qualify for $$$ is up to us, and can be changed if it isn't working the way we intend.) Elections wouldn't get dragged out to where half a term (more in the House with its 2-year cycle) is a de-facto re-election campaign. Imagine the whole thing being over in 2 or 3 months with candidates having to state their cases based on actual legislative records rather glossy media campaigns.

It's more democratic as well. I can give my Senator re-election money and he'll pocket it and say thanks, and then turn around and knife me in the back. If I want to actually have some reasonable chance of that money changing things, I have to find an interest group (GLAAD, Sierra Club, whatever) that lines up with my positions and donate to them. If *all* of their campaign money is coming from us, then they'll still be able to listen to lobbyists - but they won't be able to take their money, so why would they? The most likely answer would be that they want a big-buck lobbying job themselves, but at least in theory there would be a downward spiral of lobbying influence/money: Politician is more beholden to voter so the value of lobbying goes down, which makes the salary of a lobbyist go down, which in turn causes fewer politicians to want to be lobbyists, which means they make fewer decisions based on lobbyist input, which means Politician is more beholden to voter. Wash rinse repeat.

&gt;The amount of corporate executives turned Government officials and vice versa is unacceptable.

We can't stop it with less regulation; only more. Suppose we have a crime problem *and* a corrupt police force, and we propose to solve both by eliminating the police department. Ron Paul would say we shrink the government to the point that it doesn't have all that influence, but then the rich just shift over to buying whoever would be in charge of enforcing whatever system he imagines. ""Abolish the EPA! Tort law, man!"" is what I hear, but little about how quickly we'd shift over to the Kochs buying a set of Tort judges. They already [have their own economics department](http://news.firedoglake.com/2011/05/10/koch-u-florida-state-university-hands-over-economics-department-to-billionaire-libertarians/), so in addition to buying judges directly they'd almost certainly buy up law schools (which would suddenly be in dire need of funding in a Paul system, btw) and simply start dictating that the next generations be taught the Koch version of legal theory.

There's also the rather significant problem of Tort law doing essentially nothing to *prevent* bad acts from occurring. The judgments that come out tend slap the wrist, and that's before any of the caps on tort damages that the rightwing wants so badly. Suppose Giganticorp Industries decides it's going to do [mountaintop removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaintop_removal) adjacent to your property. Paul's system says to sue for polluting your property. Leave aside how hard it would be for some random homeowner to win in court against an outfit that size. Let's just stipulate that this person wins right away without a drawn-out, messy, expensive, legal case. (Also leave aside the part where people who don't own property have no recourse. I rent, so I guess I'd have to hope my landlord sues.) 

How much profit is that mine making? How much is your property worth? If paying the damages costs less than what they bring in, that mine's staying open. More to the point, what happens is they come in ahead of time and buy up the surrounding land. Then they blow up the mountain with no adjacent property owners to complain - fair enough right? The owners sold their property and were compensated. But what's left aside is the lack of any mechanism for anyone to prevent environmental damage once that land is sold. Then there are the various free-floating forms of pollution- how do you sort out air pollution in a tort court? Who owns the sky?

&gt;What are the biggest examples about religion being in politics?

It's hard to even figure out where to start other than to say ""the religious right."" I'd suggest *Redeeming America* by Michael Lienesch as an overview of what these folks are about and where they came from, especially the bits where he gets into the cyclical nature. *The Party of Fear* by David Bennett touches on some of this stuff as well, though it's about rightwing hysteria and fear-mongering in general. Examples would be things like Rick Santorum's candidacy for the nomination; you think anyone but religious nuts is buying all this anti-condom/anti-sex stuff? Fuuuuuux no, but that's just how much influence those people have in the GOP. There's this big stink about contraception the last couple weeks. 1/2 the states already have similar laws on the books, and nobody's forcing Catholic Hospitals etc to take tax money; it's just that choosing to do so means they have to follow HHS rules. A couple moderate Republican even proposed similar legislation a *decade ago* and nobody raised a stink then. It's pure politics, and luckily for these asshole Bishops our politics are still wired to treat every religious freakout with the utmost concern. It's a total non-issue that they've managed to dominate the airwaves with for weeks. (My own guess is that they had an idea when [this interview](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/08/retired-new-york-cardinal-egan-retracts-apology-on-catholic-priest-sex-abuse/) would be published and needed a distraction.)",1,[],['Barack Obama'],[]

14152,2012-02-09 17:22:29,Disenchanted Democrats Supporting Paul,"In 2008, Moses Caballeros was a 21-year-old activist in New York City who couldn’t wait to cast his first presidential vote for Barack Obama. He canvassed around Harlem, he proselytized to his friends, he attended rallies and meetings downtown.

Fast-forward to 2012. Caballeros feels “heartbroken.” Betrayed and lied to. He began to lose his faith in Obama when the president waffled on the wars, reaffirmed the PATRIOT Act, and signed the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA.

A friend suggested he look into Congressman Paul. Caballeros watched hours of Paul speeches on YouTube. He agreed with almost everything he heard. He didn’t tell any of his Democrat friends, partly because he didn’t fully understand what was happening. “It was kind of like a culture shock, to hear all that stuff about the Constitution,” Caballeros explains. “He seemed like the only candidate that was being absolutely and utterly honest. It was almost like I was falling in love.”

Young people have been Ron Paul fans since the mid-2000s. They list reasons that echo Caballeros’: He’s anti-war, he’s anti-surveillance, he’s pro-“liberty.” Caballeros suggests. “He’s saying the same things.” He won’t trick us like those other guys will, they think. He won’t lie to us.

Back in 2008, I loved what he said he was going to do, but now he seems to be a completely different person.

I was very excited when he won and I had a lot of faith in him to do what he said, but he just seemed to keep going back on his word. When he didn't pull the troops back, I thought ""well maybe he knows something we didn't know before."" When he did nothing about Guantanamo, I started to begin to question him. Then he became one of the most anti-marijuana presidents we've ever had and did nothing about the PATRIOT Act, which made me mad, but when he signed the NDAA it was the last straw, and I just couldn't bring myself to support him any longer.

We are out of Iraq, but we're still in the areas around it. If he really wanted to remove the troops out of the Middle East he could do it without Congress. I do agree that what he is doing is better than what most Republicans want to do, but it seems like in each election the ""lesser evil"" just keeps getting worse and worse. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely **hate** the Republicans' social policies (anti-gay, no exceptions to abortion whatsoever, using Religion to pander votes, teaching creationism over evolution, etc.), but I have come to believe they are right about the smaller size of government. I might be wrong, but I don't think many of these problems would be as apparent if more power was held by the states and less by the federal government. Yes, abortion and gay marriage would almost certainly be illegal in Alabama, Missisippi, Texas, etc., but that means the rest of the nation wouldn't have to wait on them to catch up and become tolerant. I also think that a larger federal government gives corporations *more* power based on my observation of SOPA. Like why would organizations based in Hollywood be paying a congressman from Texas to pass legislation to benefit them? And more importantly why would he listen? I think I have grown more libertarian over the last few years because I don't think that laws are the solution to our problems even though Washington seems to disagree. You might hate me for this, but I feel like Ron Paul's ideas would be best to promote the social policies Obama had in '08, and get rid of a lot of the corruption in the government as well. But I'm by no means a Republican so if Paul doesn't win there's absolutely no way in hell I'd vote for any of the others.

The indefinite detention power was passed in the 2002 Authorization of Use of Military Force, signed by Bush43. The NDAA was an affirmation of that power.

So, in 2008 you liked Obama for his progressive stances.

You're PO'd that he's had to compromise on some things, and even reverse his position on others. In a response, you're switching to the person furthest ideologically from him? You're an all or nothing kinda guy I guess, either move moderately towards a more socially fair society or go hard core in to the far weeds of ""I got mine, fuck you"" radical rightyville, eh?

""letting Dow Chemicals pour whatever they want in the water, or letting fracking companies pump whatever chemical they want into the ground to get oil out"" is not a part of his policies, I'm not sure how you can say that with a straight face.

He wants to abolish the EPA because he believes that by regulating through bureaucracy, you only provide a legal means for corruption and crony-capitalism to prevail.  You argue as if fracking is not happening right now, and would start if we abolished the EPA.  It IS happening right now, with the EPA in place.  The documentary Gasland is coming out soon discussing the crazy fracking stuff that is happening.  The current system allows the wealthy to manipulate the regulations through bribes and lobbying.  So when a person who's water has been polluted by fracking takes the company to court, the judge is forced to conclude that the company was meeting standards, and it was therefore ""legal.""  The EPA does some good, obviously, but in Dr. Paul's view, the cost does not justify results.  He would rather see the court system handle these issues.  The argument there I suppose would be that the courts could be bribed as well, but then you have laws in place to remove the corrupt judges, and take your case to a higher court.

My other issue personally with the EPA is that it forces our companies to take their pollution overseas to China or wherever.  It puts it out of sight and out of mind, so that everyday Americans can buy their IPhones and their laptops without thinking about the damage they may be doing.  That pollution will eventually affect us, but we lack the foresight to realize it.

&gt;Besides, Ron Paul doesn't give a rat's ass about individual liberties, he's all about states rights, even if it imposes on individual liberties. That's why he wants to give states the rights to outlaw birth control, abortions, and let them lock up gay people if they want.

I think it's quite clear that he care's about individual liberties.  His definitions may not be the same as yours, but I bet some of them are.  The reason I support him is because he has the conversation in the right place.  I don't agree with him on abortion for instance, but I understand his point of view, and I accept it as valid.  Saying that he is against individual liberties because he wants to protect a state's right to make it's own laws doesn't make sense to me.  The idea behind a republic is that you can have states with individual personalities united under one flag.  It can mean having some nasty states, it doesn't mean you support their decisions.

As Ron Paul likes to point out, the job growth in January, which Obama's administration reports as 250,000 new jobs, was accompanied by 1.2 million people dropping out of the workforce either because of retirement, being unemployed for too long, or moving to welfare.  When you look at it that way, it doesn't seem quite as rosy.

George Bush was pretty much the opposite of Ron Paul.  He inflated the deficit like crazy, went to war, and created a haven for crony-capitalism.  It is very disingenuous to say that Ron Paul has a ""step back and let whatever happens happen"" strategy, as his plans are some of the most detailed of any candidate including President Obama's.

Well aren't you a martyr.  The downvotes aren't because you had the bravery to support your messiah, the downvotes will be because of an absurd justification of ridiculous policies.

&gt;He wants to abolish the EPA because he believes that by regulating through bureaucracy, you only provide a legal means for corruption and crony-capitalism to prevail. You argue as if fracking is not happening right now, and would start if we abolished the EPA.

By the same logic, you could say murder is happening right now, so we might as well just make that legal, too.  The EPA isn't perfect, but the alternative... to just let it happen, will somehow be *better?*  Right now in California, there are refineries lobbying to remove regulations that require scrubbers on their smoke stacks because it's expensive.  Do you honestly think if the EPA is abolished, they'll be like ""oh ok, we'll keep them, now?""  Of course not! they're trying to have them removed, why on Earth would that change?

&gt; You argue as if fracking is not happening right now, and would start if we abolished the EPA. It IS happening right now, with the EPA in place. The documentary Gasland is coming out soon discussing the crazy fracking stuff that is happening.

I deliberately brought this up because they're currently fighting about what can and can't be done.  Do you think once the EPA is gone, they'll all just close up shop?  Again, you must be dreaming.  We need the EPA to STOP THEM FROM GROWING.  (I brought up a current fight for the EPA on purpose)

&gt;but in Dr. Paul's view, the cost does not justify results.

Because money is somehow better than clean drinking water and clean air? 

&gt;The current system allows the wealthy to manipulate the regulations through bribes and lobbying.

So since it has flaws, we should just get rid of it, so the rich can do whatever they want *without having to bribe anyone?*  This is honestly pretty retarded.  First off, why not do something about the bribes? Second, even with the bribes, it's preferable to a situation where they don't even have to bribe anyone... and even all the small companies can pollute, too. 

&gt;My other issue personally with the EPA is that it forces our companies to take their pollution overseas to China or wherever. It puts it out of sight and out of mind, so that everyday Americans can buy their IPhones and their laptops without thinking about the damage they may be doing.

Really? Don't pretend to care about this shit when the very sentence before you're saying all this stuff should be allowed.  So it's fine and dandy in the US, but oh no! Don't let it happen in poor China!   Let China come up with their own regulations.

&gt;I think it's quite clear that he care's about individual liberties. 

No, it is quite clear that he does not. Every single year he introduces a bill that lets states do things like ban birth control, arrest gay people, and whatever else is considered a ""civil right.""  Look it up.   *He wants states to be able to lock up people for being gay*.  He cares more about the rights of states than the rights of individuals.

&gt;As Ron Paul likes to point out

Well then, if the savior said it, then it must be true.  Of course he says this shit, he's running for president.

&gt;which Obama's administration reports as 250,000 new jobs, was accompanied by 1.2 million people dropping out of the workforce 

See, politicians words, he's manipulating them and apparently manipulating you, because you fell for it.  That's **250,000 new jobs**.

You say it's ""because of an absurd justification of ridiculous policies.""  Please explain how you justify that belief.

&gt;the alternative... to just let it happen

You're presenting a false dichotomy between the EPA and ""just letting it happen.""  This is not what Paul proposes.

&gt;Do you think once the EPA is gone, they'll all just close up shop? Again, you must be dreaming.

You're straw-manning.  I'm not recommending that after getting rid of the EPA we leave everyone to their own devices.  This is from the EPA website: 

&gt;Although the national study should enhance our scientific knowledge, some concerns associated with overall natural gas and shale gas extraction, including hydraulic fracturing, are already well known. These operations can result in a number of potential impacts to the environment, including:
Stress on surface water and ground water supplies from the withdrawal of large volumes of water used in drilling and hydraulic fracturing;
Contamination of underground sources of drinking water and surface waters resulting from spills, faulty well construction, or by other means;
Adverse impacts from discharges into surface waters or from disposal into underground injection wells; and
Air pollution resulting from the release of volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gases.

That to me is more than enough to prosecute these companies.  Again, judicial rather than regulatory.  We can debate the merits of both, but your debating a position that you've made up, which doesn't help anyone.

&gt;Because money is somehow better than clean drinking water and clean air?

If the US defaults, clean water and air will be the least of our worries.  I see this as a real possibility.

&gt;First off, why not do something about the bribes?

I'm all ears.  If you have some ideas, and I'm sure the populace would like to know.  This is not a divisive issue I don't think.

&gt;Second, even with the bribes, it's preferable to a situation where they don't even have to bribe anyone... and even all the small companies can pollute, too.

Again, you've misrepresented me.  I'm proposing a different course of action, not a course of non-action.

&gt;Really? Don't pretend to care about this shit when the very sentence before you're saying all this stuff should be allowed. So it's fine and dandy in the US, but oh no! Don't let it happen in poor China! Let China come up with their own regulations.

When did I say it should be allowed?  I said it shouldn't be regulated by the EPA.  Again, you have a false dichotomy between EPA and nothing.  I don't want it to happen anywhere.  The point I was trying to make was that China has no intentions to come up with their own regulations, they make trillions of dollars by leaving them lax.  What I'm saying is that if you look further into the future, their pollution will eventually effect us too.  The EPA hasn't gotten rid of pollution, it's reduced pollution in the US and increased it overseas.  The effects will still be very bad in the long-term if we don't deal with it on a global scale.

You've also incorrectly assumed that because I don't think the EPA is working that ""I don't give a shit.""  That's the attitude that makes it very hard for people of different ideologies to work together.  I care very much about the environment.  By attacking me personally, you've reduced our discussion to near worthlessness.  That's the reason I wasn't going to discuss this with you.  Very few people are able to have this kind of discussion without getting angry when a person disagrees with them.

&gt;He wants states to be able to lock up people for being gay.

You'll need to provide a source, I'm not going to chase your claims, if you have evidence I'll discuss it.  

&gt;He cares more about the rights of states than the rights of individuals.

The problem with your argument, in my view, is that you're not taking everyone's idea of liberty into account.  You're only considering the liberties you consider to be liberties.  The racist wants to be able to discriminate based on race, he considers it a right of his.  We have to be able to discuss these things.  I would guess I agree with you on what constitutes most rights, it's the protection and enforcement that needs discussion.  Just yelling that Ron Paul and his supporters don't care about individual rights is misguided and unproductive, and makes it that I have to lecture you on how to debate rather than allowing us to talk about why we believe the things we do.

&gt;Well then, if the savior said it, then it must be true.

There you go putting words in my mouth again.  I don't consider Paul a savior.  I disagree with him on a lot.  I think maybe you might be mad that I support a different candidate than you do.  This attitude hinders our discussion.

&gt;Of course he says this shit, he's running for president.

If this is supposed to support a point, I don't understand it.

&gt;That is new jobs, not new job openings, new jobs.

I understand that.  So while 250,000 new jobs have been created, 1.2 million people have dropped into the social safety net.  You must see that this is an unsustainable balance.  If that happened every month, we would quickly have a very small percentage of the population supporting a very large percentage.  That is wealth transfer from the poor to the rich.

[Here's legislation he wrote](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h539/show) and introduces every so often, that would prevent the federal government from stopping states from locking up gay people.  He literally wants to give states the right to tell you who you can and can't have sex with.  Like I said, he cares more about states rights than individual rights.  No one who actually cares about individual rights would permit (and even fight for their right to) lock up people for being gay.

These operations can result in a number of potential impacts to the environment, including: Stress on surface water and ground water supplies from the withdrawal of large volumes of water used in drilling and hydraulic fracturing; Contamination of underground sources of drinking water and surface waters resulting from spills, faulty well construction, or by other means; Adverse impacts from discharges into surface waters or from disposal into underground injection wells; and Air pollution resulting from the release of volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gases.""

&gt;That to me is more than enough to prosecute these companies. Again, judicial rather than regulatory. 

To reiterate, Dr. Paul proposes cleaning out the judicial branch, and making sure people aren't allowed to pollute other people's property, and if they do, they lose their property (or whatever the punishment is in the books, if it's not in the books, make it a law.)  The law has gotten so huge that no one can read it.  The point of the constitution to keep it simple.  Instead of creating an agency, which you then have to write laws for, just write the law, and make sure it's enforced.  Don't create another agency, all the pieces are already there, you just have to make sure they do their jobs.  Right now we fight corruption in the judicial branch and in the agency.  Why not just the judicial branch?  We've split our focus.

Thank you for the article, I hadn't read it.  I disagree with Paul here.  I would be fine with a state banning all sodomy, but by targeting a gender I believe you violate the 14th amendment.  ""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""  I believe sex goes under equal protection of the law.  So I would argue with Paul on this point.

However you make a mistake when you go ad hominem: ""Dr. Paul believes gay sodomy is a state's decision, which it should not be, therefore all his ideas are bad.""  That doesn't make sense.

I can debate Dr. Paul on this issue, because I can point to the basis of his logic (which is the constitution - which by the way is what we should all be basing our logic on, and if our logic is different than the constitution we should be proposing an amendment) and say ""no, you're wrong because of the 14th.""  And he may have a rebuttal that I will consider at that time.

That all aside, I don't think he cares about state's rights any more than individual rights, he cares most about the constitution of the United States of America.  He has the conversation where it should be: on the law of the land.  The Republicans and the Democrats spend time fighting over the details of the law rather than the law itself.  You can't focus on the details without the big picture.  Big picture comes first, then details.  That is at least how I think.

right, so we just let them do whatever they want, and either boycott or sue them.  Exactly what I said earlier. So, no, not a straw man.

Seriously, though. You think it's better to be reactive than proactive?  No one who has ever been involved in a lawsuit in any way has ever said ""lets just let people do what they want then sue them later.""  No, I want someone to tell Dow Chemicals they can't pour mercury into the water *before* they pour mercury into the water.  I don't want them to pour poisons into the water, then I have to dedicate the next 3-5 years of my life to suing them. That's really lame.

How old are you? Do you remember what it was like in the 80s, when the EPA was just a small fledgling organization that had just started all of the rules?  In Los Angeles, smog was so bad, it would literally hurt to breath outside.  There were signs along bayous and rivers in the south where I grew up saying not to eat the fish, and to stay out of the water.

&gt;The law has gotten so huge that no one can read it. 

Oh, well if the law is confusing, lets just throw it out.  Seriously? You're claiming if a law is too long to read, we should just get rid of it?

Yea, I don't think that's the point of the Constitution. You're making that up.


&gt; I would be fine with a state banning all sodomy

Are you shitting me?  No wonder you like Ron Paul.  You obviosly don't care about individual freedom as well.  You're honestly the first person I've ever talked to that said you would be fine with the government telling you what kind of sex you and your significant other could have.

&gt;However you make a mistake when you go ad hominem: ""Dr. Paul believes gay sodomy is a state's decision, which it should not be, therefore all his ideas are bad."" That doesn't make sense.

Haha, you just accused me of ad hominem then went all strawman on me.  I never said all his policies are bad because he thinks states should be allowed to lock up gays, in fact, I didn't even say all his policies are bad. What's even weirder about this accusation is that you argued against my reasons for the EPA, and now you're pretending I didn't even say that?

That's not exactly what you said earlier, and I'm not talking about suing or boycotting, I'm talking about pressing criminal charges.  So, yes you're still strawmanning.

As you work to prosecute polluters, and enforce harsh penalties, the cases get easier to win, and act as a deterrent.  Plus, even with the EPA, we still have cases like the BP oil spill where we're going to court anyway.  Why do we need the 2nd step?

&gt;Seriously, though. You think it's better to be reactive than proactive?

I do in cases where being proactive is unsustainable.  This sounds very ""pre-emptive strikey"" to me.  We are broke.  We're approaching WWII debt levels, without the benefit of a spike from a world war.  The debt just creeps higher and higher, steadily this time, if you look at the graphs it looks a lot like the roaring 20s.  Things seemed so good, people made the mistake of thinking the stock market would never go down.  When I hear people say: ""the US will never default.""  I hear the same naivety.  I really don't mind environmental regulation, if I were in a position to be president, it would probably not be my first cut, but I'm fine with Dr. Paul cutting it, because our deficit is 1.3 trillion, even with 1 trillion in cuts like Dr. Paul proposes, we would still be borrowing 300 billion per year.

&gt;How old are you? 

I'm only 25, so I do not remember the 80s.

&gt;There were signs along bayous and rivers in the south where I grew up saying not to eat the fish, and to stay out of the water.

Do you have some evidence that these signs are gone and that the EPA was the driving force behind that?

&gt;In Los Angeles, smog was so bad, it would literally hurt to breath outside. 

Los Angeles and California worked to clean up the smog, the EPA had little to do with it from what I understand.  It's California where my car had to be smog-checked not Ohio where I'm from.  Not the EPA, but state law:

Why aren't these lobbying groups spending resources lobbying the city and promoting their cause rather than suing the EPA?  If there was no EPA, they would be forced to.

&gt;You're claiming if a law is too long to read, we should just get rid of it?

No, I wasn't, you continue to put words in my mouth.  I said it has gotten too long to read, and then I said:

Obviously not. But it's high on Ron Paul's list, and it's high on my list.  Cancer is a much bigger fear for me than not being able to smoke pot or anything in the latest NDAA. I come from an area with a 50% cancer rate, and a 0% locked-up-without-a-trial rate. Cancer is a MUCH more real threat, and I certainly don't want to wait until I have cancer to find out which company was pumping carcinogens into the air so I can sue them from my death bed.


&gt;Why did we need the EPA to outlaw chemicals that cause birth defects? Why not just outlaw them and prosecute if people break the law?

What?? They *are* outlawed. Who do you think did that? The EPA!  When you get rid of the EPA, who do you suggest outlaws them? Who do you suggest does the research ahead of time? Who do you suggest notifies everyone of the dangers?   

&gt;What additional role does the EPA provide that trial doesn't

Really?  like 90% of what they do can't be replaced with a trial.

They are the ones that oversee the research and decide on how the regulation is implemented.  They also do things like manage endangered species, monitor air/water quality, monitor for radiation.  

Seriously. When it comes to endangered species, do you honestly think that people can just go sue everyone that had anything to do with the destroying of a species?  Like... how would that even work?  How is a trial going to run tests on water quality?  How is a trial going to conduct research on greenhouse gasses? That's absurd.

Not only do I think you have any idea what the EPA does, but the way you talk about ""just go to trial,"" I don't think you have any idea what it takes to actually go to court.

&gt; **The Obama administration will continue the Bush administration’s practice of sending terrorism suspects to third countries for detention and interrogation,** but pledges to closely monitor their treatment to ensure that they are not tortured, administration officials said Monday.

&gt; Human rights advocates condemned the decision, **saying that continuing the practice, known as rendition, would still allow the transfer of prisoners to countries with a history of torture. They said that promises from other countries of humane treatment, called “diplomatic assurances,” were no protection against abuse.**

&gt; “It is extremely disappointing that the Obama administration is continuing the Bush administration practice of relying on diplomatic assurances, **which have been proven completely ineffective in preventing torture,”** said Amrit Singh, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, who tracked rendition cases under President George W. Bush.

The occasion was the 38th annual African American History Month celebration in Connecticut, hosted by the People's World.

Speaking to a packed hall, George decried the disrespect and racism expressed against President Barack Obama by the Republican leadership. ""This has never been done to any president before,"" he said.

He also criticized Democrats who have not challenged the attacks on the country's first African American president and the racist atmosphere they create.

""The struggle for freedom, for jobs and for restructuring the way America works in 2012 is developing a popular front against some of the most sinister forces of capital and big business,"" said George.

""From the tea party that has been financed by the billionaire Koch brothers to the ugliest bunch of Republican candidates to ever hit the campaign trail, we will have to fight hard to keep them out of office. They repeatedly demonstrate a brutal arrogance toward working people. Without hesitation, they spew racist diatribes against African Americans and our Latino brothers and sisters,"" he said.

George recounted how his union is calling meetings with all members who are not registered to vote to discuss how their votes can make the difference in whether a candidate who wants to curtail union and civil rights is elected, or if someone who can be held accountable gets into office.

""We who believe in freedom cannot rest - Reclaiming the Struggle in 2012"" was the theme of the events in Hartford and New Haven, which attracted diverse turnouts of 150 people.

Special tribute was paid to Henry Winston on the 100th anniversary of his birth. George, the son of immigrants from the Caribbean, began his working life in the Fur and Leather Workers Union. He interwove his own story with that of Winston, who organized African American youth in the south in the 1930s and became National Chair of the Communist Party USA in 1966.

Blind due to racist denial of health care while imprisoned for his ideas in the 1950s, Winston famously proclaimed, ""They have taken my sight but they can never take my vision.""

""If Winston were here today he would bring it all together with his concise insight and wit,"" said George. ""His passion was to help young people find new paths to help working families,"" he said. ""But Henry Winston is here today. We remember him and we must promote his legacy to the next generation so that the 200th celebration of his birth will even be more significant in a better society.""

Both events included cultural presentations by area youth. The Hartford audience enjoyed performances by Union Cartel and New Elm City Dream.

In New Haven, prizes were awarded for the high school arts and writing competition sponsored annually by the People's World, as parents, sisters, brothers and teachers looked on.

All entries were published in a booklet and all participants received recognition certificates. The students submitted work on the theme ""What is your vision for the future? How can being involved in the struggle for freedom and equality bring positive change to your life and the larger community?""

The Hispanic Heritage Dancers from Fair Haven School performed at the New Haven event along with songs by Scotticesa Marks, drumming by Brian Jarawa Gray and a performance by New Elm City Dream.",2,['Barack Obama'],[],['Barack Obama']

Note paragraph 4 re ""any suspected terrorist"" (answer: civil trial)

Feb. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Obama administration released procedures giving civilian prosecutors latitude in devising the rules for how suspected terrorists should be handled during detention, interrogation and prosecution.

The administration was required to come with the procedures issued yesterday under a provision of last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Congress had sought to give the military more control over people accused of plotting against or attacking the U.S.

“A rigid, inflexible requirement to place suspected terrorists into military custody would undermine the national security interests of the United States, compromising our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals,” the policy directive says.

The guidelines say that any suspected terrorist detained by a law enforcement agency will be handled under standard criminal procedures until it’s determined that the individual is covered by the law and should be turned over to the military. 

The guidelines repeat President Barack Obama’s previous statement that the directive does not apply to U.S. citizens.

16517,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan**

I've got some webspace (bought it to use as a personal ftp server; I hardly ever use it) that I don't use, and have been tossing around the idea of using it for a sort of counter-disinformation/talking points compendium sort of deal. It would be incredible to have a non-sensationalized, factually-sound &amp; cited resource, written in easy to understand language to counter these sort of claims. 

Most importantly, it would be more lastingly visible than this post, which, useful as it is, will be lost to the nether in a few days. If anyone has any html/css/whathaveyou experience and would be capable of throwing something somewhat eye-pleasing together, I'd be more than happy to foot the bill for hosting/dns registration. 

If not, I'll try to get something basic thrown together in a week or so, when I've got some free time (University student; upper-level political science midterms mean I'm doing well to get any sleep as is).

16521,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

16523,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

16525,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

16527,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted.

First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved.

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

16532,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

The Dems are looking to take another stab at the DISCLOSE Act, but I'm not sure how that has a chance unless the US people wake up and stop being dumbasses. 

If Obama loses in 2012, things will certainly get worse. The economy might still do OK for awhile, but who knows what Romney will do abroad. He says he'll stay in Afghanistan, though the guy flip flops worse than anyone I've ever seen.

The one thing that is certain is, if Obama is elected, that gets you closer to overturning *Citizens United*. All you have to do is keep a Democrat in the White House for enough years that one of the 5 conservative justices that supported the decision retires. Remember the vote on *Citizens* was 5 conservative justices for, 4 liberal justices against. ",3,[],['Barack Obama'],[]

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved.

And Obama is still pushing for ALL Americans to go to college, when the Federal government created the student loan crisis. http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/why-on-earth-do-we-have-a-student-loan-crisis/

And Obama is still taking money from misogynists and 1%ers. Bill Maher, who repeatedly described Sarah Palin as a ""cunt,""  personally donated $1million to Obama. http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/03/shepac-ad-bill-maher-obamas-million-dollar-man/

Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true.

First of all, using a vulgar word doesn't make Maher a misogynist, otherwise me calling you a DICK would make me a misandrist.

**I have to go out to dinner now, but please give me more sources we can put in here to fight some of the disinformation I've seen on Reddit lately about Obama** 

edit: some spelling",2012-03-12 14:49:01,obama,t3_qs617,"&gt;Show us exactly where in the Constitution that the President is empowered to act on behalf of ""the 99%"" and against ""the 1%."" Please. Enlighten us foolish plebes.  

I told you this was copy-pasta from somewhere else. This was orginally in reference to ""What has Obama done for the OWS movement."" There you have it. 

&gt;And Obama is still taking money from misogynists and 1%ers. Bill Maher, who repeatedly described Sarah Palin as a ""cunt,"" personally donated $1million to Obama 

So we can judge presidential candidates on their donors now? Ok, what about the fact that Ron Paul continues to recieve donations from white supremacist groups like Stormfront:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22331091/ns/politics-decision_08/t/paul-keeps-donation-white-supremacist/ 

Or the fact that Paul's biggest donors are the Bilderbergs: http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedpolitics/ron-pauls-biggest-supporter-is-a-bilderberger

I'll take Obama's donations from comedians any day of the week, no matter what sort of shocking things the comedian may say.

16541,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true.

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted.

I do agree tho that the American people need to wake up and smell the coffee, there are too many mindless voters on both sides who simply blindly follow without thinking for themselves. In a few generations if we keep passing down clear thinking, Politics might clean themselves up simply because our great great great grand children won't be so easily fooled as past generations. I probably disagree with you on a few things but as long as you encourage logical thinking and educate as many as you can than you done good in my book.

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**

First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true.

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html)

**I have to go out to dinner now, but please give me more sources we can put in here to fight some of the disinformation I've seen on Reddit lately about Obama**

16548,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

16550,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

While the litany of objections to Trotskyism may be hyperbolic, you deliberately invite them, seems to me. 

Rather than be annoyed by such a predictable response, and calling people twats (a politically incorrect, sexist, abusive term, however intended), you should, indeed, just change the freaking name (and watch your filthy mouth), lol.

Of course, identifying yourself as ""Left"", however you frame it, will not cut you a lot of slack, re: similar knee-jerk reactions from some elements...

Per my own username, LOL, which can also elicit hysteria from some, despite it's generic expression and debatable implications, in terms of political tendency, and whether all propaganda must necessarily be automatically considered misinformation.

But I've found that any reasonable remark, regardless of where it's coming from, is subject to be attacked, viciously even, with the most absurd diversionary adhominem dismissals, from some...especially when you hand them a gratuitous opening, lol.

Oh well...that's the internets for ya...

16552,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted.

16555,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan**

**I have to go out to dinner now, but please give me more sources we can put in here to fight some of the disinformation I've seen on Reddit lately about Obama** 

edit: some spelling",2012-03-12 17:23:59,obama,t3_qs617,"TV as a ""press"" medium is largely incapable of presenting news in an attractive way to the entertainment-hungry audience.  One of the best shows is the News Hour on PBS, and some of the others are on Sunday morning.  Most of the rest is simply too short, too shallow, and too focused on eye candy to be worthy of being called news.

And there is no avoiding this.  We're [too stupid for democracy.](http://news.yahoo.com/people-arent-smart-enough-democracy-flourish-scientists-185601411.html)",2,[],['Barack Obama'],[]
16557,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

16559,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted.

16562,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**

**I have to go out to dinner now, but please give me more sources we can put in here to fight some of the disinformation I've seen on Reddit lately about Obama**

16564,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

**I have to go out to dinner now, but please give me more sources we can put in here to fight some of the disinformation I've seen on Reddit lately about Obama** 

edit: some spelling",2012-03-12 20:55:35,obama,t3_qs617,"I think the whole 2012 NDAA (from December of 2011) was one of the biggest moments of anti-Obama misinformation circlejerking on Reddit. 

Most importantly, the NDAA does not give the executive branch any new powers concerning indefinite detention. The following clause was added to the Counter Terrorism section (where the indefinite detention text is located), on Obama's behest after his original veto threat:

&gt;Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.

Secondly, the bill itself is extremely misunderstood. It wasn't just a one line bill, it was the authorization of the entire military budget for 2012. If, for some reason, the bill was actually vetoed we would have gone right back into a government shutdown, meaning a lot of people would have stopped receiving paychecks until it was passed. 

And, as you said, the bill was veto proof. Even if it had the most egregious, evil wording ever (which it doesn't) and allowed babies of libertarian couples to be shot on sight or something ludicrous, the president (even if his last name was Paul) couldn't have stopped it being passed. To be upset with Obama about this bill is just stupid and misleading.

Edit: looks like one of the great posts linked here debunks the idiocy surrounding the NDAA much more clearly and eloquently than I can: http://www.reddit.com/r/obama/comments/qobls/fact_checking_a_cherrypicked_version_of_obamas/",1,[],['Barack Obama'],[]
16566,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted.

16571,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**I have to go out to dinner now, but please give me more sources we can put in here to fight some of the disinformation I've seen on Reddit lately about Obama**

16573,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

&gt;Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki

No , Condaleeza Rice and and Robert Gates worked on SOFA starting in June 2008 that eventually led to them agreeing to end the war in 2011. Even your own sources you linked to show this.
negotiating with Malki.The only part it mentions Obama is ""This was about the same time Maliki made friendly comments about Barack Obama's 16-month timetable.""
16 month time table. He sure kept that promise didn't [he](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUTYL8HfCGo). Another quote from the article you linked to ""The right wing has been pretty quiet in general about the SOFA, But the left has somehow misread this section as ""Obama's hands are tied, he has to stay until almost 2012!"" which is just not true"". Paragraph four clearly states that the Iraqis can kick us out any time they want, and we can leave any time we want -- as long as the deadlines are otherwise met""
Actually evidence shows that Obama actually wanted to continue to have troops beyond [2011](http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/0/21/how_the_obama_administration_bungled_the_iraq_withdrawal_negotiations)


&gt;No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be

Acording to Pentagon, 23% increase in the number of “Private Security Contractors” working for the Department 
of Defense in Iraq in the second quarter of 2009 and a 29% increase in Afghanistan and
Overall, contractors (armed and unarmed) now make up approximately 50% of  the “total force in 
Centcom AOR [Area of Responsibility].” This means there are a whopping 242,657 contractors working on these two US wars.

&gt;Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan
Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well

Yes Obama has continued the war in Afghanistan. He had a surge in Afghanistan of initially 21,000 and then
On Dec. 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment to Afghanistan of additional 30,000 U.S. military personnel. So that 
brings up his total to 51,00. Two thirds of U.S. Deaths in Afghanistan have died since the [surge](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/two-thirds-us-deaths-afghanistan-have-occurred-obama-s-surge)
This ""aggressive"" withdrawal would leaves around twice as many troops than before he took [office](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2007099/Obamas-plan-withdraw-30k-troops-Afghanistan-risky.html)

&gt;Obama signed the NDAA
It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted.

Bush vetoed 2008 NDAA with a [pocket veto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_veto). It also passed with veto proof majority.

&gt;Romney Raised More Than 5 Times as Much Money From Wall St. Employees as Obama

Yes and Obama outraised McCain in 2008 and [recieved more money than any presidential candidate for past 20 years.](http://dailycaller.com/2011/10/10/obama-attacks-banks-while-raking-in-wall-street-dough/2/)
. Goldman Sachs was one his top [contributers](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cid=N00009638).


&gt;Cut salaries for 65 bailout executives 

From your own source ""While these executives will have cash salaries capped at $500,000 this year, their total compensation can be much higher.""
And ""However, since the salary cap was not required by law, the seven large recipients of the bailout loans – General Motors Co., Chrysler Group LLC, Ally Financial Inc., 
AIG, Bank of America Corp., Chrysler Financial Services Inc. and Citigroup – pushed back against Feinberg, the Detroit News reported."" and
The report cites one case in which Feinberg caved into demands from Ally Financial that one of its executives be compensated $1.5 million a year, 
including $1 million in salary, the AP reported.[source](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120124/kenneth-feinberg-pay-czar-excessive-pay-tarp-executives)

&gt;Established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform

How does this serve the 99%. By proposing slashing taxes for wealthy?[dropping the top rate from 35% to 23%—thereby adding tens of billions to the deficit](http://www.inthesetimes.com/working/entry/6666/deficit_commission_proposes_tax_breaks_that_will_increase_deficit/).


&gt;Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. 
Created new criminal penalties for mortgage fraud

These two are the same thing again?

&gt;Established new offshore investment policy that promotes in-sourcing.

By having as your close advisor the CEO of GE.GE has been busy outsourcing American jobs, eliminating a fifth of its U.S. workforce since 2002.


&gt;Closed offshore tax safe havens, tax credit loopholes

[Politifact has rated this as a half truth](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/19/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-closed-offshore-tax-safe/)

These 14 points are entailed in the Dodd Frank act. Most of them are from the same source.

&gt;Directed congress to pursue Goldman Sachs for securities violations.

Goldman Sach is under investigation by Senate subcommitee. How did Obama direct them? Did he does this before he hired Henry Paulson, who helped deregulate the economy?

&gt;Reformed credit card swipe fees

Does not protect the little guy.[The swipe fee cap technically exempts financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or less. In theory, this exempts all but 3 
out of the 7,000+ credit unions.](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/2011/durbin-amendment-explained/)

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved.

**I have to go out to dinner now, but please give me more sources we can put in here to fight some of the disinformation I've seen on Reddit lately about Obama**

I might be late to the party but as far as I can tell, Washington Times and Washington Post both lean right, despite any claims otherwise.

16577,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

16579,2012-03-12 00:15:52,I'm getting a little sick of the anti-Obama disinformation I'm seeing almost everyday on Reddit. Can we work together as community by putting together a list discrediting the myths and focusing in on the things he has done? ,"I see a lot of disinformation and bad things about Obama these days, so I want to create one post to discredit the crap and focus on the good things Obama has actually done. First I want to focus on some myths: 

**""Obama is just following Bush's timeline to end the Iraq war""** 

Actually the truth is, Obama put together the timeline for withdrawal working in conjunction with the Iraqi president Malki. Bush nor McCain had any intentions of signing the ""overly aggressive timeline"" Barack Obama had put forth. However, by the time it came to sign, Barack was president elect and Bush had completely caved. Signing Obama's timeline into law with SOFA: [1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-iraq-withdrawal-ti_b_668173.html) [2](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/08/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-1/) [3](http://www.chrisweigant.com/2008/12/09/a-close-look-at-the-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement-part-2/) 

**""Obama just replaced our combat troops with private contractors, spending levels are the same""**  

No, there are contractors in Iraq but nothing like the extremist Libertarians try to paint it out to be, and those are being reduced also [1](http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120308/NEWS03/703089841/-1/NEWS03) [2](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-the-us-should-reverse-course-on-iraq/2012/02/22/gIQAfrDgYR_story.html) [3](http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/2012/03/defense-budget-when-national-security-becomes-last-priority)

**Obama is just continuing the war in Afghanistan** 

Again, not true. An aggressive withdrawal has been announced there as well (too aggressive for many Republicans): [1](http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/the-coming-upheaval-in-u-s-afghanistan-strategy-20120311) [2](http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Obama-Time-has-come-to-wind-down-Afghan-war-3384297.php) [3](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/212603-gop-hits-obama-for-afghan-apology-warns-against-rapid-withdrawal)

**Obama started a third war** 

Libya is not a war. It's a UN intervention and there is a big difference [1](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-20/opinion/bergen.libya.us_1_arab-league-obama-administration-libyan-intervention?_s=PM:OPINION) [2](http://www.juancole.com/2011/08/top-ten-myths-about-the-libya-war.html) 

**Obama signed the NDAA** 

It passed with a VETO proof majority. Passing a ""symbolic veto"" would have played right into the politics the Repbulican party wanted. [1](http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/confused-about-ndaa-and-detention-provision) [2](http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/2012/01/last-word-on-ndaa-if-you-dont-like-it-stop-helping-right-wingers-win.html) [3](http://azvern.posterous.com/for-the-idiots-who-call-obama-a-traitor-for-s)

Instances like GM success story, passing health care bill against all odds, restoring federal funding for research on human embryonic stem cells, repealing DADT, killing Osama, and more success stories like that give me hope for my country.

Without health care reform, I would no longer be covered on my mother's health insurance. I'm one of those. I work 40+ hours a week at two jobs, which is the problem. I don't work enough hours at either job to qualify for their health care program. I am generally healthy.

Recently, I broke my shoulder while skiing. I have skied for years, and I rarely fall, except of course that day. After a trip to the ER, I have seen multiple doctors and received multiple x-rays. I have no idea how much I would be in debt if it weren't for Obama. Because of health care reform, my shoulder is healing nicely. I am able to go to physical therapy. I'm not back to full strength but I will be. I won't have a lasting deformity.

I have a friend who had almost the exact same injury three years ago.  He did not have insurance so he did not see a doctor for it. He still can't raise his arm all the way up, and there is something visibly wrong with his shoulder when he doesn't have a shirt on. He was in pain for months because of his shoulder. He missed significantly more work than I did. Because of Obama, that isn't me.

Your friend is an idiot- Emergency rooms in the US cannot deny care based on one's ability to pay, and many states offer assistance to those who can't afford their own coverage (i.e. MediCal) 

I was in a similar situation as you once- although I was riding, not skiing, I broke my leg rather than shoulder, and it happened 6 years ago, before the ACA was anything more than a pipe-dream.

Should I be grateful to George W. Bush the hospital admitted me and operated without knowing if I was insured? I'm not. I'm grateful to my parent's for their insurance that helped after-the-fact, but the president and his policies had nothing to do with the care I received.

The ACA is little more than a hand-out to the insurance companies because Obama didn't even try for single-payer and only half-heartedly pursued a public option before capitulating to corporate demands.

It is one of many reasons I will **not** vote for him again.",-3,[],[],['George W. Bush']

#1 Passed Health Care Reform: yeah, it sorta give the poor some coverage, but at what cost? The insurance companies still make human suffering a profitable business, and last I check they spend/waste 14% of their revenue to verify how much each person is insured against what illness. This is a waste compared to a universal single payer system where everyone pays a flat tax and everyone is covered. 

#2 Stimulus: At about 40% tax cuts? We have a 2 trillion hole in the nation's infrastructure needs and 60% of 787 billion isn't big enough.

#3 Wall St Reform: Are you fucking kidding me? the Too Big To Fail banks are bigger than ever, even bigger than before the crisis. The Credit Default Swaps markets are still not regulated. Larry Summers, who championed the dismemberment of Glass-Stegal, is still advising Obama. Surprise!  Doing the same thing over and over and expect different result is the definition of insanity. This is Obama proving himself insane.

#4 Ended War in Iraq. Really? So how come we still have a green zone in Iraq's Capital?

#5 Began Draw-down in Afghanistan: We should pull out completely. We have no business in that country.

#7 Auto-Bail out: This is what Obama should have done: Loan the same amount of money to Tesla, and let them buy out GM's factories and hire their workers. It is only fitting that the company that killed the electric buses in California be killed by an Electric car company.

#8 Recapitalize Banks: Are you fucking blind? Letting the bank set their balance sheet to whatever imaginary number they want by getting rid of the mark-to-market rule is no recapitalizing. The zombie banks are making a killing by borrowing at 0% from the Fed then lending to the Treasury at 3~5%. WTF how the fuck is that supposed to help our country?

#11: Mubarak: Obama asking him to go was not the determining factor. It's like a foot ball fan claiming he singlehandedly won the game.

#12: No one went to jail for Bush torture. What was reversed?

#13: Again, nothing to do with Obama's policy. His policies is exactly the same as Bush

#14: Kicked Banks Out of Federal Student Loan Program: Yes but Fannie Mae is still in the Federal Student Loan Program, and they are the biggest private bank / government backed entity ever.

I honestly think Obama has more to do with it than any Republican governors. I recall seeing a study that cited Republican governed states as doing worse on unemployment. 

Even with that study, it is hard to perceive effects directly. A fact that the GOP will use to their advantage. So this country will keep giving them chance after chance despite Watergate, Iran-Contra, the Iraq war fraud, and the crashes of 1929 and 2008. Basically, the GOP is better at running for office, the Dems are better at running the country. 

It doesn't help matters that the Left eats their own and nitpicks everything they disagree with our guys on. And that we seem to be afraid to be tough with the right in the same way they are tough with us. I think we should heed the words that Randall Terry, one of their anti-choice psychos, once said, ""Let a wave of intolerance and hate wash over you."" That is how you deal with the right.

People have already forgotten that the economic crash happened during the Bush Administration, that the bank bailout was signed by Bush's pen, that Bush's policies and tax cuts for the wealthy during wartime (two wars he started, no less) are the reason for turning a budget surplus into what was already the biggest debt problem we've ever had.

And while job losses continued in the beginning of the Obama administration, it was clearly just a continuation of a trend that had *started* during the Bush years. Any look at unemployment graphs would show as much - and they'd also show the unemployment rate suddenly halting and slowly reversing after Obama passed the stimulus bill. The stimulus clearly *worked*, it just wasn't *enough*.

People have *also* forgotten that Obama inherited an economy on the brink of collapse, and his efforts to deal with this problem have been attacked *every step of the way* by Republicans and even conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats. They forget that he signed one of the biggest tax cuts in US history, giving working Americans hundreds off their federal taxes. They forget that he put into law that health insurers could no longer deny coverage for ""pre-existing conditions"". They forget that he took single-payer health care off the table before it ever even got on the table, and was still attacked by the right for dictating that ""death panels"" would force your grandma into euthanasia. They forget that virtually every time he extended his hand to Republicans in compromise, they took what he offered and then went back to painting him as a monster.

Republicans say that the stimulus did nothing, as if the economy just happened to suddenly stop spiraling downward just at the same time the stimulus passed. They say that Obama's high taxes are to blame for our economic woes, despite that their revered Reagan had higher taxes, and Obama's stimulus actually *lowered* taxes, even when many in his party were screaming for him to raise them.

People are worried. People are scared. They're worried that they'll lose their job, or get a pay cut, or that they won't be able to find a new job in time to pay the rent. They're scared about something which they know is not *their* fault, and they want to know who to blame, who to point the finger at, who to fight so they don't have to be afraid anymore. And, how fortunate is this - there's a bunch of people more than happy to tell you who's to blame! And it's the Democrats and their evil taxes and their mean ""class warfare"" and their restrictive ""regulations""!

Well, it sure sounds bad when they say it, doesn't it? And they sure seem convinced of it... and man, I hate paying taxes, so they must be on to something, right?

... and so, you get a nation half-full of people who are scared and worried being told what to do by the very people who put them in their bad situation in the first place. And why not? There's no benchmark for voting. There's no requirement that a voter know what they're voting about. Their head can be filled with lies that twist right into left and yes into no, but as long as they fill out their voting form, there vote is just as good as yours. Even better than yours if they live in a rural area (where most Republican voters come from), since we don't operate on a popular vote.

* By managing marijuana like alcohol and tobacco – regulating, taxing and enforcing its lawful use – America will be better off.  The billions saved on marijuana interdiction, along with the billions captured as legal revenue, can be redirected against the individuals committing real crimes against society.  

* Governor Johnson believes it is insane to arrest roughly 800,000 people a year for choosing to use a natural substance that is, by any reasonable objective standard, less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is advertised at every major sporting event.

* Abuse of hard drugs is a health problem that should be dealt with by health experts, not a problem that should be clogging up our courts, jails, and prisons with addicts. 

* We can never totally eliminate drug addiction and drug abuse. We can, however, minimize these harms and reduce the negative effects they have on society by making sure drug abusers are able to access effective treatment options (jail is not an effective treatment option).

He sounds like a president i should be proud of, he *says* some very good things and does so with elegance and grace. However, on issues I really care about, which is actually a very long list, I've been consistently disappointed by his actions. While I do find a few small goodnesses that Obama can be credited with, (like tossing out DADT) these are like roses dropped on a dirty street.  I've mostly seen things change for the worse in the last 4 years. 

Obama dissembled and obfuscated during his campaign on both cannabis reform, civil liberties, and peace. He has continued the wars of aggression at home and abroad, and failed to prosecute the previous administration for war crimes.  He is promoting the continuation of wars of aggression, he makes me into a criminal by virtue of me being an American. 

I'm not a fan of the health care option because it is a buy-out for the insurance companies, I want health care reform, however, any reform that does not put the health insurance companies completely out of business is not a reform, it is an institutionalizing by government of a failing system, one that supports a group of parasitic originations that feed off the illness and suffering of the people.

I've rarely had health insurance, I cannot afford it, and I will not be part of giving any money into that system. If I find myself in a position where I am being legally required to, I'll have to leave this country or be a criminal.  The health care that The President managed to pass is one of my biggest beefs with him. Nothing would be better than what was done. 

I will not fall for the #1 is better than #2 so you must pick #1, if I see a politician not holding true to the platform he ran on, I'm out. It's like catching a lover in a BIG lie, it's a deal breaker.  It should be for everyone, and then we would have better leaders. If I take cues from any one voice, it is Glen Greenwald's

I'll likely be voting for Ron Paul, he is not perfect and there are areas which I strongly disagree with him, but I know he is not bought and sold by the M.I.C, I can see that he will bring positive sweeping reform in more areas then this country has seen in half a century.

I suppose my political views may be best described by lockean liberalism, but labels are difficult, I'm for progress but my view of what that means probably does not match up all that well with what ever the progressive party platform is.

Except that he has. Your gripe appears to be with the states. They're taking steps towards legalizing it, the first step being to allow the states to legalize it if they want, and only step in when state laws are broken. California happens to have strict laws saying where they can be set up and how much they're allowed to make.  Colorado has dispensaries, too, but they're not being shut down since their laws are much more lenient. (I have a friend who works at one in CO, they aren't worried about being shut down at all... I don't know about any other states, just mine and the one where my friend works)

&gt;he is laughing off and belittling the reasoned call

He laughed *once* and that was because out of ALL the things going on, two wars, recession, jobs, all of these things, someone basically said ""when are you going to let us smoke pot?""  This after letting states decide on their own pot laws.

I have to agree that it was a bit humorous. I would like them to legalize pot, too, but there's no way that should be at the *top* of the list. There was 100 other things that guy should have asked before that.

&gt;I also live in CA. The only dispensary within hours of my location was shut down a week after Obama took the presidency.

Where do you live?  Some counties have outlawed them.  If you have none near you, I'm assuming you live in one of those counties.  Don't blame Obama for something your county did.  Plus, if it was shut down weeks within Obama taking office, it's unlikely he had anything to do with it, it took a little while for those policies to kick in.   

&gt;do not have a doctor to get a card recommendation from so i've never been to any of them.

Take a trip to Venice Beach, not only will you see that they're not even pretending to shut them down (every other building has a dispensary in it) but there are doctors offices that will write you a prescription for $150.

""CLASSIFICATION
	
Hallucinogen
Both Cannabis and Tetrahydrocannabinols, the active chemicals contained in Cannabis plants, are Schedule I in the United States. This means they are federally illegal to cultivate, buy, possess, or distribute (sell, trade or give) in all forms (cannabis plants, extracts, hash, hash oil, thc, etc) except synthetic THC (Marinol) which is Schedule III.

Practically, simple possession of small amounts is almost never prosecuted federally.

The federal scheduling of Cannabis was disputed in 1988 by Judge Francis Young, an administrative law judge for the DEA, who recommended that marijuana be reclassified as schedule II on the grounds that if a respectable minority of doctors endorse it, then it has a ""currently accepted medical use"". [link](http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_law.shtml)

Schedule I status of cannabis is in the presidents preview, and the current legal status does not match the medical and scientific findings. Obama is not allowing anything; he is directly standing in the way of reform with no basis, no discussion, and a belittling of a serious issue that is causing untold suffering and death internationally. Saying that this is about hippies wanting to get high is ignorant, or dissembling.

No it's not. Maybe that's why you're focusing so hard on a seemingly arbitrary thing. ""Schedule"" basically means ""potential for abuse.""  Being on that list doesn't make it illegal, marijuana is a schedule I narcotic, it's in the same group as a [ton of pain killers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Schedule_I_drugs_(US\)) that are definitely not illegal at the federal level. Basically, schedule I means there are minimal or no known valid uses for the drug.  

*Reclassifying it is not what you want.* If they just reclassify it, you still need a prescription, therefore you're still in the same situation you have now. That would do absolutely nothing to curb the Mexican cartels you talk about. You want them to decriminalize it which is *exactly what they've already done*.  Since it's already been decriminalized, it's up to California, not Obama to change this.

Like I said, taking it off that list will have no effect on what California decides to do with it, legality-wise. You're holding something arbitrary against the president for reasons I cannot understand.  Now that you understand how little effect reclassifying.

So what you're saying is that this has nothing to do with legality and decriminalizing and everything to do with stickin' it to Obama?  Come on, man, you can't just admit to that at the end.  To reschedule it, they'd have to go through a huge ordeal, prove the findings have them go over everything, then probably take a vote on it.   So Obama skipped all that part and said ""go ahead, do what you want"" and you're *upset about it?*  What the fuck is wrong with you?  If we go that route, it'll NEVER be decriminalized.

You think we’re too militarily heavyhanded now?  Having Romney in the White House would be a progressive’s worst nightmare, and a textbook repeat of the Bush years.

So, be upset about the issues you care for.  Make your feelings known and try to affect change.  But be aware that as you focus on only a few elements of an exceedingly complex world, and while you choose to ignore the long list of Obama’s positive achievements, you only aid the likelihood that come November, we’ll return to all that which Obama has been struggling to make right, and which Americans like you and me fight against.

But let’s be clear about something of the utmost importance: Barack Obama is not George W. Bush, nor is he Mitt Romney.  If you feel outraged about drone attacks, or continued raids on marijuana users and distributors, just imagine your reaction if Romney were in the White House, with a GOP-controlled House of Representatives, a conservative-led Supreme Court and a slim Democratic majority in the 
Senate that seems incapable of passing anything.

I’m not saying to ignore your concerns.  I’m saying to put them in perspective.  Drones and cannabis are far from the only issues that matter.  People are struggling to live day to day.  Obama’s inauguration came in the midst of the worst economic disaster in three generations, a disaster which fed upon the policies of the previous eight years, and one which is only now finally turning around.  The barest research will spotlight the extraordinary efforts Obama has put forth, from the economy and equal rights, to our standing in the world, from environmental protection and health care, to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Every economic indicator is up and on a steady rise, we’re out of Iraq, we’re winding down in Afghanistan, we’re respected again internationally and a level of common sense has returned to our policies.

The guy is not a messiah.  I too am disappointed about certain issues.  And it’s important to never relent in fighting for the things which are dear to us.  But please consider everything he has accomplished.  Lilly Ledbetter.  Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.  The Iraq War.  The Detroit bailout.  Not defending DOMA.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Kagan and Sotomayor.  bin Laden.  The Affordable Care Act.  A rebounding economy.  Then consider what would happen in a Romney presidency.  You’re upset about marijuana raids now?  You think we’re too militarily heavyhanded now?  Having Romney in the White House would be a progressive’s worst nightmare, and a textbook repeat of the Bush years.

So, be upset about the issues you care for.  Make your feelings known and try to affect change.  But be aware that as you focus on only a few elements of an exceedingly complex world, and while you choose to ignore the long list of Obama’s positive achievements, you only aid the likelihood that come November, we’ll return to all that which Obama has been struggling to make right, and which Americans like you and me fight against.  Thank you.

19544,2012-05-01 16:50:40,Progressives of reddit: there's more at stake here than drone strikes and legalized pot,"As a liberal who came of political age at the dawn of the George W. Bush years, I know well what it’s like to feel like you’re being led down the right-wing rabbit hole, as your country squares off against common sense, the Bill of Rights, secularism and other nations.  And as someone who witnessed the revelations of waterboarding, extraordinary renditions, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and countless other violations and atrocities, it haunts me that the Obama Administration has seen fit to continue even one or two of those policies, if on a smaller scale (drone strikes without due process, for example).
But let’s be clear about something of the utmost importance: Barack Obama is not George W. Bush, nor is he Mitt Romney.  If you feel outraged about drone attacks, or continued raids on marijuana users and distributors, just imagine your reaction if Romney were in the White House, with a GOP-controlled House of Representatives, a conservative-led Supreme Court and a slim Democratic majority in the 
Senate that seems incapable of passing anything.

I’m not saying to ignore your concerns.  I’m saying to put them in perspective.  Drones and cannabis are far from the only issues that matter.  People are struggling to live day to day.  Obama’s inauguration came in the midst of the worst economic disaster in three generations, a disaster which fed upon the policies of the previous eight years, and one which is only now finally turning around.  The barest research will spotlight the extraordinary efforts Obama has put forth, from the economy and equal rights, to our standing in the world, from environmental protection and health care, to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Every economic indicator is up and on a steady rise, we’re out of Iraq, we’re winding down in Afghanistan, we’re respected again internationally and a level of common sense has returned to our policies.

The guy is not a messiah.  I too am disappointed about certain issues.  And it’s important to never relent in fighting for the things which are dear to us.  But please consider everything he has accomplished.  Lilly Ledbetter.  Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.  The Iraq War.  The Detroit bailout.  Not defending DOMA.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Kagan and Sotomayor.  bin Laden.  The Affordable Care Act.  A rebounding economy.  Then consider what would happen in a Romney presidency.  You’re upset about marijuana raids now?  You think we’re too militarily heavyhanded now?  Having Romney in the White House would be a progressive’s worst nightmare, and a textbook repeat of the Bush years.

So, be upset about the issues you care for.  Make your feelings known and try to affect change.  But be aware that as you focus on only a few elements of an exceedingly complex world, and while you choose to ignore the long list of Obama’s positive achievements, you only aid the likelihood that come November, we’ll return to all that which Obama has been struggling to make right, and which Americans like you and me fight against.

However, according to you, gaining the intelligence necessary to kill Osama justifies the Iraq war--really? Tens of thousands of deaths between U.S. Troops and Iraqi citizens as well as over a trillion dollars spent to rid a country of WMD's they DIDN'T HAVE does not make that war justified. 

Had we not invaded Iraq in the first place it NEVER would have become a haven for terrorists in the first place!

Do you get it? We took our eye off the ball in Afgahnistan--and Pakistan, to an extent--to dump over a trillion dollars and lose tens of thousands of lives then by CHANCE we got info on Osama.

I don't know where you get your figures, we have had 4000 casualties in Iraq. there have been fewer civilian deaths during our presence than there were in all of the years of Saddam Hussein's regime.

The Overseas Contingency Operations, that includes Iraq and Afghanistan, consist of 4.3% of the federal budget every year. that amounts to about $163.93 billion a year. that's BOTH Iraq and Afghanistan. in comparison, those retarded entitlements Obama wishes to expand cost 60.9% of our federal budget. which is more of a waste of money?

IF terrorists had not gone to Iraq, we would have never gotten Osama. Furthermore, freeing TWO countries as a model of what democracy can do in place of terrorism and tyranny? that was far more important than killing some terrorist who was in hiding and had little to no operational effect on the war.

even your statement that more troops would be alive is BS! think about it for a second. had Osama Bin Laden not made Iraq a battleground to make it another Vietnam, where would all of his forces been focused? this is just logic, it doesn't require much effort on your part to think about it.

Moreover, laying the United States' failures to control foreign human rights abuses, and our own failures to protect U.S. citizens from government abuse, at the White House's doorstep really elides by the complexity of international human rights issues and the deep interplay between institutional inertia and  public policy decisions. 

Once again, there's much to criticize Barack Obama for.  If human rights is a serious issue for, I wholeheartedly recommend you volunteer or donate to a candidate that shares those views.",6,[],[],"['Bill Clinton', 'Barack Obama', 'George W. Bush']"

Though I meant it to mean that they both just suck in general I stand by my claim that they both suck for the health of women.  ""Health of women"", is by my definition, to include not detaining them without cause, not propping up dictatorships that treat them like cattle or worse, not illegally bombing them and not denying them certain medicine (that fact that you don't think those are in part health issues is beyond me).

Which leads me to the next criticism of yours.  You want to go back to your original comment saying voting for Obama isn't the best thing.   I'm assuming you didn't read their statement, because they were talking about the election and who to vote for.  There are currently 2 viable options, Obama and Romney.   They're claiming voting for Obama is the best way to assure women's health, you said they were wrong. The only other option is to vote for Romney, but for some reason that's not right to you, either.

Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing that during Romney’s four-year term as Massachusetts governor, the number of jobs went up 61,000. By contrast, the number of jobs under Obama has dropped by 1.86 million. Under Romney's leadership and economic reforms the Massachusetts unemployment rate went from 5.6 percent to 4.7 percent. Obama has us stranded at 8% and went almost to 10.

When Romney entered office in January 2003, Massachusetts was shedding jobs at a faster rate than the country as a whole. The state had ridden the dot-com boom to greater riches, but when the bubble burst, it struggled to stem the losses.

The state had lost about 158,000 jobs, or 4.7 percent of its workforce, from the first quarter of 2001 to the month Romney took office, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In early 2004, a year into Romney’s term, Massachusetts began to stop losing jobs. The state then added jobs every year until Romney stepped down in early 2007. All the data is right in that link above.

&gt;In the mid-eighties, a European retail outfit called Makro, a kind of continental Costco, was looking for an executive to help run its U.S. business, and it called a Boston supermarket executive named Tom Stemberg, inviting him to tour a pilot store outside of Philadelphia. The store didn’t impress him much, but he noticed that the office-supply aisle was absolutely packed with shoppers. He told the Makro executives to abandon their model and concentrate solely on office supplies; when they declined, he decided to give it a try himself. Boston business is a small world, and when he went looking for a venture-­capital partner, he eventually found his way to Mitt Romney and his new $37 million fund. **“Most V.C.’s thought it was ridiculous,” Stemberg says. “Mitt was highly unusual in that he went to the research level to study it.”**

&gt;**The trouble with the idea, to Romney’s subordinates at Bain Capital, was that the small businesses Stemberg needed to draw weren’t accustomed to visiting a store for office supplies;** they got them from separate vendors, some who ­delivered—one supplier for pens and paper, one for printer cartridges, and so on. “Some of us were worried that we needed to change consumer behavior,” recalls Robert F. White, one of the firm’s managing directors.**Romney persisted.** As members of the group surveyed more and more small businesses in suburban Massachusetts, they discovered that if you asked a small-business manager how much he spent on office supplies, he would give you a low estimate and tell you it wasn’t worth it to send someone in a car to buy them. But if you asked the bookkeepers, you got a far higher number, about five times as much—high enough, Romney and Stemberg thought, to get them to come to the store. **The idea became Staples. Romney’s Bain Capital colleagues were soon helping to select a cheaper, more efficient computer system for the first store; they were helping stock the shelves themselves. As Staples succeeded, and began to expand, they looked at analytics for everything**—the small-business population around a proposed store site, traffic flow—and gamed out exactly how big a customer would need to be before it demanded delivery. **Romney sat on the Staples board for years**, and his company made nearly seven times what it invested in the start-up.

As part of the expansion, Gronet and fellow managers hoped to cut costs by speeding up the automated assembly. To do so, they bought a custom-made assembly tool from VDL, a Dutch company. The company had never built that kind of equipment, but it promised the assembly tool would arrive in the summer of 2010. By that time, Gronet had been pushed out as chief executive.

They're challenging it because their ill informed and in the beginning the birth certificate wasn't released, he lived in Malaysia and was born to a Kenyan citizen.  Some groups hoping to beat the democrat party felt that they could use those facts and hide others to push that line.  Again, are some people racist and does that come into play for some?  Sure it does...some people voted for him be cause he is black and some people didn't vote for him because he is black.  Both are unfortunate.  You've nicely framed your second point to box out Condi and Clarence Thomas.  Where the Dems racist when they did everything they could to fuck over Clarence?  The black community is in the pocket of the Dem party (sadly) because of the welfare state and it started during the civil rights movement.  The Dems have been affective at painting the Republicans as racists and labeling rightwing blacks as uncle toms.  Few uneducated blacks are going to join the party that wants to give them less free shit and also leave them subjected to abuse by other blacks.  Who wants to be called an uncle tom?

Conflicts aren't always country-country things, after all, nor are they necessarily knock-down drag-out fights to the finish.

As it happens, in this particular situation, the US is actually working *with* the Pakistani government. We're there with their permission. The article you linked to even implies as much:

&gt; U.S. officials, who spoke yesterday on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence, said they expect Pakistan may order the CIA to stop using a remaining air base from which the officials say they have controlled Predators to target militants sheltered in Pakistan’s tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.

Pakistan *ordering* the US to stop? Gee, that sounds like a sovereign nation asserting their rights to me. Which would of course be the reason for this part at the beginning of the article:

&gt; President Barack Obama has ordered a sharp increase in drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Pakistan in recent months, anticipating the CIA may soon need to halt such operations in Pakistan’s territory, two U.S. officials said.

So, the short version is, we're there because they said we could be, because they claim they totally want to get rid of the terrorists too. However, they've been lying to us, and we're pissed about that, and they don't approve of our use of the drones, so they're pissed about that. So we're both pissed at each other.

So it might get to the point where Pakistan decides that it no longer wants to cooperate with our anti-terrorism efforts, which is their right as a sovereign nation. At that point, Obama and Congress will need to decide if we're better off just leaving things there alone, or if their lack of cooperation justifies escalating things into a Congress-approved military engagement (which is fundamentally different than an all-out war). I suppose they could decide to declare war, but that's a bit of an extreme measure to take, and hardly necessary when all the US is looking to do is kill the terrorists.

So, does an agreement between Pakistan and the US give the United States President, through the CIA, the power, vested in it by Congress, to use attacks by drone against foreign terrorists who are technically not affiliated with any country? Well, it's a complex issue, but if I had to give an answer I'd say yes. Yes it does.",6,[],[],['Barack Obama']

A lot is being said in the media about Mitt Romney not being ""likable"" or that he doesn't ""relate well"" to people. Frankly, we struggled to understand why. So after much research, we have come up with a Top Ten List to explain this ""unlikablility.""

The Top Ten Reasons To Dislike Mitt Romney:

1. Drop-dead, collar-ad handsome with gracious, statesmanlike aura. Looks like every central casting's #1 choice for Commander-in-Chief.
2. Been married to one woman his entire life, and has been faithful to her, including through her bouts with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis.
3. No scandals or skeletons in his closet. (How boring is that?)
4. Can't speak in a fake, southern, ""black preacher voice"" when necessary.
5. Highly intelligent. Graduated cum laude from both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School ...and by the way, his academic records are NOT sealed.
6. Doesn't smoke or drink alcohol, and has never done drugs, not even in the counter-culture age when he went to college. Too square for today's America ?
7. Represents an America of ""yesterday"", where people believed in God, went to Church, didn't screw around and worked hard to become successful!
8. Has a family of five great sons....and none of them have police records or are in drug rehab. But of course, they were raised by a stay-at-home mom, and that ""choice"" deserves America 's scorn.
9. Oh yes, he's a Mormon. We need to be very afraid of that very strange religion that teaches its members to be clean-living, patriotic, fiscally conservative, charitable, self-reliant, and honest.
10. And finally . . . pundits say because of his wealth, he can't relate to ordinary Americans. I guess that's because he made that money himself, as opposed to marrying it or inheriting it from Dad. Apparently, he didn't understand that actually working at a job and earning your own money made you unrelatable to Americans.

My goodness, it's a strange world, isn't it?

Personal Information:

His full Name is: Willard Mitt Romney

He was Born: March 12, 1947 and is 65 years old.

His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of the State of Michigan

He was raised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan

He is Married to Ann Romney since 1969; they five children.

Education:

B.A. from Brigham Young University ,

J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard University

Religion:

Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints

Working Background:

After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon missionary.

After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar exam, but never worked as an attorney.

In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment firm, one of the largest such firms in the United States .

In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts and lost to Ted Kennedy.

He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.

In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit.

Some Interesting Facts about Romney:

Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in Massachusetts , turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores employing 90,000 people.

Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply and many others.

He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year.

He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight years.

He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church for ten years.

He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee for three years.

He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts for four years.

He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.

Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money, service and time than most men.

And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his income....

Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.

Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:

He will show us his birth certificate

He will show us his high school and college transcripts.

He will show us his social security card.

He will show us his law degree.

He will show us his draft notice.

He will show us his medical records.

He will show us he has nothing to hide.

Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the United States .

You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is, and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility. I know he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into. We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background can do it.

But, on the minus side, he never was a ""Community Organizer"", never took drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the US.",2012-08-22 18:23:56,obama,t3_yn2qg,LOL,-1,[],['Joe Biden'],[]

Economics 104
Government Spending, Fiscal Policy, and the Debt

There is a Republican named Paul Ryan who is creating proposals for dealing with some minor budget problems associated with Medicare.  His proposal is to slash the Medicare budget from 9% of GDP to 1.6% of GDP by 2021. On the contrary, Obama’s budget would drop it to 4.9% of GDP. As of now, there are premiums and deductibles for Medicare paid from the government for people who are sixty-five years old and older, and in return for paying in, they receive full coverage of a wide range of medical services.  It might seem like a good idea with throwing Ryan’s vague GDP percentile numbers in thin air and seeing what happens, but the sick part of his proposal is to stop federal funding and have it be replaced by vouchers. Government is paying for half of all health care costs currently, which is what a government should do. There is a government in place to help out society as a whole. Without government intervention, might as well be thrown to the dogs to fend for ourselves like a bunch of barbarians. There are lots of the problems that deal with the Ryan Medicare proposals. Ryan didn’t factor in the rising costs to technology progress, the aging population, and shrinking coverage from private sectors, which will increase the cost of Medicare overtime because private sectors will jack up the price since they are starting to become scarce. The private sector would be the main basis of health care, if this bill actually passed through Congress, and I disagree fully on getting vouchers for Medicare on the private market without government intervention. He’s proposing a plan that’s “just enough health care” for the elderly. Well, he can’t judge what kind of coverage that a person needs because people’s health care needs are very different and diverse. For example, my grandpa passed away in 2006 and my grandma is 74 and she is on Medicare. Since my grandpa isn’t alive anymore, she can’t afford too much, but with Ryan’s health care proposal, people like my sweet grandma would get “just enough” to pay her medical bills, which is malarkey. What if her breast cancer returns and needs to go back to the hospital for extra chemotherapy and radiation? The vouchers wouldn’t fully cover those expenses, and it’d have to come out of her pocket or some other financial means, which means my grandma couldn’t afford to get extra radiation, so Ryan’s plan would pretty much leave my grandma to die. Giving out vouchers is more of an unusual punishment than a proposal to help out America. Ryan’s medical voucher proposal, instead of Medicare, is planned to begin in 2022. This new voucher system is for one to receive a private plan, called a “premium support”, instead of vouchers to make it sound better to the public. My view is that Republicans scared elderly people into thinking that their Medicare would be cut, which put Republicans in front to win the midterm elections in Washington D.C., but even Republicans are second guessing what Ryan is proposing. Ryan’s proposals to deal with the rising cost of Medicaid are to use block grants. Instead of a state matching program to Medicaid like it is today; Medicaid would be similar to how ex-President Clinton set up welfare during his term in the 1990’s. Ryan is planning on having cost controls for states rather than relying on the government. Cost controls will determine how much a state government is able to spend on Medicaid. If the Federal Government puts all the pressure on states to take care of all of Medicaid, then that would put a strain on state budgets. This would raise inflation within a state, raise prices, and cause an increase in unemployment. Block grants are a downfall for people with lower paying jobs because if inflation is increasing and there is a medical emergency, there isn’t much leeway to for an under-paid person to afford that with just a grant instead of complete coverage. There are many flaws within Ryan’s plans. The problems he forgot about are medical inflation, rising case loads, and a growing population. Obama’s plan is to help out people without health insurance, which is a very good system to get America back on its feet from the budget crisis. On the contrary, Ryan’s private health care system’s prices would rise significantly for individuals. His proposal forgot about social security, which is in fact going to hell since our population is growing at a slower rate than most countries, and with policies put in place today to try to help out the crisis of social security; they are just slowing the diminishing rate of social security. At this rate, people who are working will have to work into their 70’s to make financial means work because there will be no social security left. In Ryan’s proposal, he would be cutting 6.2 billion dollars in programs, but he doesn’t specify which ones he would be cutting. It leaves a person to question if he’s talking about Grants for young adults going to college, such as the Pell Grant, which are for young adults who do not have financial support from parents, or would he possibly cut food stamps for people in an unfortunate situation. He’s pulling numbers from thin air for his proposal, which makes it more of an idea than a proposal. My view of the Ryan proposals for Medicaid is that it’s completely irresponsible to put the costs solely to state governments. Ryan says the proposal is going to strengthen Medicaid but it’s going to weaken it to the point of crumbling. There is federal funding for Medicaid for a reason. Ryan is cutting taxes for private companies and large corporations, but as we have learned in the past from the Bush tax cuts, it doesn’t work. Ex-president Bill Clinton made a budget for the 1990’s deficit from the Reagan tax cuts, and it looked very promising before George W. Bush came into the White House, but as soon as Bush made the tax cuts for large corporations, the economy plummeted. The Bush tax cuts fortunately end in 2013. Economists learn from past actions to either redo a successful action, or disregard a mistake, and tax cuts for the rich only hurts the rest of America. Cutting taxes for the rich is the wrong direction, but he should make tax cuts for the Middle to Lower classes so they would spend more to get the economy as a whole running more smoothly. As an alternative to Ryan’s proposal, since his own political party won’t even support his bill, I propose that the government intervenes with individuals on a one to one basis to see what medical needs they need, kind of like a social worker. Based on a person’s past medical history and current problems, a government worker will either approve of full coverage or an economical systematic monthly plan with an emergency package just in case something happens and they need to go to the hospital for a short to a long period of time. Then I would propose that the government official would be that person’s health care advisor, which would keep people from just using the system to their own advantage. It’d be a tactical system with the emergency package as more of a savings account in the government, a security blanket if you will, just in case something happens. It’s like having an emergency credit card in your wallet just in case your car breaks down. The government could use some of this emergency money to throw into health care programs for technology and improvement, but only the amount of tax rate in a state, such as Wisconsin’s government could use 5.5% of emergency funds. When a person dies, the money would filter back into the main program. This would also create jobs within the government, and it would be more of a closely monitored system, but yet it would be a lot more personable.

Ryan didn’t factor in the rising costs to technology progress, the aging population, and shrinking coverage from private sectors, which will increase the cost of Medicare overtime because private sectors will jack up the price since they are starting to become scarce. The private sector would be the main basis of health care, if this bill actually passed through Congress, and I disagree fully on getting vouchers for Medicare on the private market without government intervention. He’s proposing a plan that’s “just enough health care” for the elderly. Well, he can’t judge what kind of coverage that a person needs because people’s health care needs are very different and diverse. For example, my grandpa passed away in 2006 and my grandma is 74 and she is on Medicare. Since my grandpa isn’t alive anymore, she can’t afford too much, but with Ryan’s health care proposal, people like my sweet grandma would get “just enough” to pay her medical bills, which is malarkey. What if her breast cancer returns and needs to go back to the hospital for extra chemotherapy and radiation? The vouchers wouldn’t fully cover those expenses, and it’d have to come out of her pocket or some other financial means, which means my grandma couldn’t afford to get extra radiation, so Ryan’s plan would pretty much leave my grandma to die. Giving out vouchers is more of an unusual punishment than a proposal to help out America. Ryan’s medical voucher proposal, instead of Medicare, is planned to begin in 2022. This new voucher system is for one to receive a private plan, called a “premium support”, instead of vouchers to make it sound better to the public. My view is that Republicans scared elderly people into thinking that their Medicare would be cut, which put Republicans in front to win the midterm elections in Washington D.C., but even Republicans are second guessing what Ryan is proposing. Ryan’s proposals to deal with the rising cost of Medicaid are to use block grants. Instead of a state matching program to Medicaid like it is today; Medicaid would be similar to how ex-President Clinton set up welfare during his term in the 1990’s. Ryan is planning on having cost controls for states rather than relying on the government. Cost controls will determine how much a state government is able to spend on Medicaid. If the Federal Government puts all the pressure on states to take care of all of Medicaid, then that would put a strain on state budgets. This would raise inflation within a state, raise prices, and cause an increase in unemployment. Block grants are a downfall for people with lower paying jobs because if inflation is increasing and there is a medical emergency, there isn’t much leeway to for an under-paid person to afford that with just a grant instead of complete coverage. There are many flaws within Ryan’s plans. The problems he forgot about are medical inflation, rising case loads, and a growing population. Obama’s plan is to help out people without health insurance, which is a very good system to get America back on its feet from the budget crisis. On the contrary, Ryan’s private health care system’s prices would rise significantly for individuals. His proposal forgot about social security, which is in fact going to hell since our population is growing at a slower rate than most countries, and with policies put in place today to try to help out the crisis of social security; they are just slowing the diminishing rate of social security. At this rate, people who are working will have to work into their 70’s to make financial means work because there will be no social security left. In Ryan’s proposal, he would be cutting 6.2 billion dollars in programs, but he doesn’t specify which ones he would be cutting. It leaves a person to question if he’s talking about Grants for young adults going to college, such as the Pell Grant, which are for young adults who do not have financial support from parents, or would he possibly cut food stamps for people in an unfortunate situation. He’s pulling numbers from thin air for his proposal, which makes it more of an idea than a proposal. My view of the Ryan proposals for Medicaid is that it’s completely irresponsible to put the costs solely to state governments. Ryan says the proposal is going to strengthen Medicaid but it’s going to weaken it to the point of crumbling. There is federal funding for Medicaid for a reason. Ryan is cutting taxes for private companies and large corporations, but as we have learned in the past from the Bush tax cuts, it doesn’t work. Ex-president Bill Clinton made a budget for the 1990’s deficit from the Reagan tax cuts, and it looked very promising before George W. Bush came into the White House, but as soon as Bush made the tax cuts for large corporations, the economy plummeted. The Bush tax cuts fortunately end in 2013. Economists learn from past actions to either redo a successful action, or disregard a mistake, and tax cuts for the rich only hurts the rest of America. Cutting taxes for the rich is the wrong direction, but he should make tax cuts for the Middle to Lower classes so they would spend more to get the economy as a whole running more smoothly. As an alternative to Ryan’s proposal, since his own political party won’t even support his bill, I propose that the government intervenes with individuals on a one to one basis to see what medical needs they need, kind of like a social worker. Based on a person’s past medical history and current problems, a government worker will either approve of full coverage or an economical systematic monthly plan with an emergency package just in case something happens and they need to go to the hospital for a short to a long period of time. Then I would propose that the government official would be that person’s health care advisor, which would keep people from just using the system to their own advantage. It’d be a tactical system with the emergency package as more of a savings account in the government, a security blanket if you will, just in case something happens. It’s like having an emergency credit card in your wallet just in case your car breaks down. The government could use some of this emergency money to throw into health care programs for technology and improvement, but only the amount of tax rate in a state, such as Wisconsin’s government could use 5.5% of emergency funds. When a person dies, the money would filter back into the main program. This would also create jobs within the government, and it would be more of a closely monitored system, but yet it would be a lot more personable.

Economics 104
Government Spending, Fiscal Policy, and the Debt

There is a Republican named Paul Ryan who is creating proposals for dealing with some minor budget problems associated with Medicare.  His proposal is to slash the Medicare budget from 9% of GDP to 1.6% of GDP by 2021. On the contrary, Obama’s budget would drop it to 4.9% of GDP. As of now, there are premiums and deductibles for Medicare paid from the government for people who are sixty-five years old and older, and in return for paying in, they receive full coverage of a wide range of medical services.  It might seem like a good idea with throwing Ryan’s vague GDP percentile numbers in thin air and seeing what happens, but the sick part of his proposal is to stop federal funding and have it be replaced by vouchers. Government is paying for half of all health care costs currently, which is what a government should do. There is a government in place to help out society as a whole. Without government intervention, might as well be thrown to the dogs to fend for ourselves like a bunch of barbarians. There are lots of the problems that deal with the Ryan Medicare proposals.

Just as I wouldn't want William Shatner or Patrick Stewart as mods of /r/startrek or I wouldn't want Shigeru Miyamoto or Reggie Fils-Amie as a mod of /r/Nintendo.

I'm saying that the President's AMA could have just as easily been run by a staffer because [his twitter account](http://twitter.com/BarackObama) is run by staffers.  He marks twitter updates made personally by signing them ""-bo"" which the AMA announcement tweet did have but nothing pointed to his actual participation in the AMA.

You seem to be mistaking which claim is requiring proof, I'm saying that it's the claim that Obama was actually involved in his AMA; I'm not making a claim of my own. Now you're probably thinking, ""You said Obama wasn't involved in his AMA,"" but again, I'm saying that because he never proved it was him.

Appointing him honorary moderator says you choose the latter option.

That's not much of a surprise, really, for visitors of this subreddit - it basically *is* an echo chamber. But whether that's a good thing is still a legitimate point to raise; I don't see why one would have to be kidding to do so.

Your insurance premium isn't unreasonable, but I understand your frustration. Don't blame the ACA, though. Without it, your sister's stomach flu would be a pre-existing condition and she could be denied coverage (that sounds whacked, but it used to be true).

Let's both keep up the good fight. Single payer will get here, it just will take a while.

Trust me on this, though. Insurers would not have done this on their own. And, be glad you live in CA. I am in CT, and we had zero issues with the online exchanges.

The rarity these days are people willing to take a moment and discuss their differences in detail. We seem to sit on opposite sides of the political fence, but I feel strongly that whatever the issue is, the two of us could reach a compromise that is mutually acceptable.

By Susan Duclos - Cross posted at Before It's News


The situation in Ukraine and the rhetoric from the US government on the authority of Barack Obama has shown the world how unrealistically Obama sees the world, specifically his foreign policy decisions, to which the Washington Post editorial board says, as is quoted in the video below from Mox News, ""Obama has a foreign policy based more on how he thinks the world should operate than on reality.""


That is it in a nutshell as the panel discussion provides evidence of. Russia and Vladimir Putin has clearly shown publicly how weak and ineffective the Obama administration truly is. While Obama's vision of Utopia is to downsize the US military, other countries are expanding theirs. Obama's threats of sanctions and chest puffing is having no effect on Russia who understands there is nothing Obama can doabout Russia taking back the Crimea region of the Ukraine.


The US warships sent to the region is all show, and that show is having no effect, proven by the latest developments where Russia just took over a Ukrainian military base, without a shot fired.


Obama backed the wrong horse in Egypt by backing the terror group Muslim Brotherhood. They were removed, so Obama failed. Obama backed the wrong horse in Syria by backing al-Qaeda linked rebels to remove Bashar Assad, Obama failed, Assad is still the Syrian president. 


What Obama has done is weaken the US to the point where CHina, Russia and others have absolutely no respect for him, the power of the US and laugh off Obama's ""red lines"" as the continue to cross them even as he or his administration is issuing them.


What Obama has done though is created an atmosphere where other growing countries now have the ability to strike a devastating blow against the US, not with bombs or warships, but economically by dropping the dollar and creating currency and trade wars where the US dollar will be replaced as the world reserve currency which causes the much talked about global economic reset.


Obamas fantasy land has just become America's nightmare and his head is so far up.......in the clouds, he doesn't even understand the damage he caused OR like many believe, he has deliberately worked to bring America down from within.


Let's go back to Obama's support of the Muslim Brotherhood for a second..... their stated goal is to bring America down from within.


Written sometime in 1987 but not formally published until May 22, 1991, Akram's 18-page document listed the Brotherhood’s 29 likeminded ""organizations of our friends"" that shared the common goal of dismantling American institutions and turning the U.S. into a Muslim nation. These ""friends"" were identified by Akram and the Brotherhood as groups that could help convince Muslims ""that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and 'sabotaging' its miserable house by their hands ... so that ... God's religion [Islam] is made victorious over all other religions.""

Look at the image included very carefully, note the names and look each one up.

Pretty much says it all, doesn't it?

Ask yourself if any leader would bring the enemy into their administration, an enemy who has stated their goal was to bring down a country from within, unless that leader was part of the plan?

Just something to think about.

For example: Libya.

Pre-Benghazi the Republican talking point was that we shouldn't be spending money in Libya, we need to disengage from the efforts that brought doẃn Khadaffi, etc etc.

Then after Benghazi it's all ""Terrorism! Why didn't we spend the money there to protect our people? Impeach!""

When you know it's the job of Congress to spend that money and all they had been talking about was how to spend LESS money in Libya, not more.

But then I guess this all depends on you watching and remembering what congress does.

We saw the same thing under Bill Clinton. Clinton goes to congress to get money to get Bin Laden. Congress says ""We won't give you money without clear, obtainable goals and a clear exit strategy.""

Bush is in office - Blank check. Oh, hey, Iraq might not have been involved at all? That's ok, pal, no goal or exit strategy needed.

The reason Putin felt free to act in the Ukraine wasn't because Obama was weak or had bad foreign policy, it was because he faces continual internal opposition. If Obama wanted to do something about the Ukraine tomorrow, he couldn't due to congressional opposition.

I invite you look at an article  I published  last September to remind you just how brilliantly he handled Syria:

--------------------------------------

**President Obama’s Brilliant Strategy No One Seems To Recognize**

*September 8, 2013* 

**By Wayne Bomgaars**

As the media interprets recent events as Obama’s march to war, America and the world falls for it hook, line and sinker. Say what you want about Obama but he is a very smart man. He would never ask permission he did not need from Congress to launch a strike on Syria unless he knew beyond a doubt he could get it. That is if his real intentions were to actually carry out military operations. But why on earth does it appear he wants this war?


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After agonizing over this question over and over I began to realize there is only one logical explanation. He does not. Only a month ago the GOP was accusing Obama of being weak for not acting when the “red line” was crossed. There was pressure for him not only from the US but from the world as well. The reputation of the great American defender was on the line. Still it was obvious at the time Obama did not want to rush into another quagmire, bogging down the rest of his tenure as our nation’s leader. But the evidence kept rolling in. He had to do something not only for his reputation as a world leader but for the United States as well.

Cue the British Parliament to provide Obama with the perfect out. Just days after Britain’s governing body eliminated any joint action with the US to participate in a coalition to strike the Assad regime, Obama made a surprising and decisive move. Against the advice of all his advisors, he put any US participation in the hands of our do-nothing Congress with no chance they would give him the approval he needed. Not because it isn’t the right thing to do but because Obama was asking for it. The outcome is a given if you just take a step back and look at the situation rationally. And there is no way Obama is going to launch this attack once Congress says no. It would be political suicide. Bush may have gotten away with it but America is not going to let it happen again. The fallout would signal the end of any and all effectiveness the Obama administration for the remaining years of his presidency. And history would place him with the likes of war criminals like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Let me repeat this. Obama is not that stupid!

So why then does our president appear to be beating the drums of war? The simple answer is he is now regarded as a hawkish leader before the US and the world. And he does so without having to fire a shot. He appears wholeheartedly in favor of a strike and is playing the part well. The hawk stands upon his perch without lifting a talon as Congress now takes any and all responsibility for lack of action on the part of the US. And during this entire debacle, he even manages to make republicans come out as anti-war; something even no one thought possible only a month ago.

If this sounds like an improbable scenario I ask that you to ponder for a moment the potential outcome:

No war
 Obama and America look strong and world leaders should not doubt Obama’s willingness to take action
 Congress was made to do their job
 Congress will take the responsibility of inaction
 Republicans have to pretend they are anti-war
 Americans comes out against any further wars thereby providing the beginning of the end to our perpetual war
 Puts pressure on the UN to take other action
 Suddenly the UN is eager to accept other harsh non-military actions against Syria

And there is even the added bonus that the GOP weakening the push to shut down the government over the debt ceiling will not proceed with the intense battle anticipated. Next week Congress returns for only nine days. Nine days to act on the Syrian War, the debt ceiling, immigration, the Voting Rights Acts and many other important issues.

Seeing they can barely rename a post office, Congress will not have the ability to once again play games with by demanding cuts and further tax cuts for corporations. It will have to accept a reasonable offer or be blamed for damage to our nation’s credit rating. Republicans are very aware they will face blame and backlash should this happen.

Tell me this isn’t the best outcome ever. And I honestly think this was Obama’s intention from the beginning. You know damn well if he didn’t do anything, Republicans would be calling him weak because of the corner he had painted himself in when he talked about the red line.

Granted, Obama made a mistake with his “red line” comment, but by acting in a calm savvy manner, he can come out looking the part of the tough guy without even taking a swing. And he smiles as Congress does for him what he wanted in the first place.

If America could just set down their pitchforks and torches for a moment, they would be able to see what a brilliant strategy this is.

1. Obama wanted to attack Syria and only sent it to congress when the Brits backed out. Russia came up with the chemical weapons idea. Keep in mind, whoever used chem weapons , the only reason the conflict has been so deadly is because the west, including the USA, gave weapons, even manpads, to terrorists  in Syria.

2. The reasons we were in Benghazi is because we were funneling weapons we had given terrorists in Libya  to Syria via turkey. Stevens had met with Turks earlier in the day when he was killed. Why were we giving terrorists weapons in Libya? To overthrow their leader. That country, like Syria, is a fucking mess, and we are culpable.

3. Bringing up McCain doesn't invalidate all of obamas war mongering.

4. On to this article. Putin never wanted east Ukraine. He took Crimea without firing a shot. What exactly is Obamas strategy? It's not even close to a secret that our state department runs foreign policy. And they have a neo con agenda, just like bush did.

Here is common sense 101:  If you want 1 acre to be handed to you without any complaints, you go after 100 acres.  Then you ""negotiate"" about the other 99 acres, making it seem as if you are backing down.  When you ""back down"" and the other side gives you that 1 acre as if it didn't matter and feels as if they won something, it's a clever way to let you opposition feel like they're not backed into a corner and have a way out.  

In other words, if you just go after Crimea and that's it, the negotiations will center around Crimea and you will get less.  If you ""go after"" all of Ukraine, the other side will just hand you Crimea on a silver platter when you promise to back down from the rest of Ukraine.

I love what you said about the atheists and the gay community, but honestly, Joe Biden kind of forced his hand. He originally ran on what I guess you would  call an ""Anti-gay marriage view"", but honestly, a president doesn't have any say in gay marriage since it is a state run structure, and he also never openly said he was in favor of traditional marriage, as opposed to the other party. 
At first, I really didn't like the idea of Obamacare, only because I don't like that we are now forced to buy something. But, seeing it operate now, it really isn't all that bad. In fact, most of the things I have heard about it since it was enacted have been good.
But when it comes to economics, a president doesn't have much say either (not to say he doesn't have any). He has also increased the debt by a few trillion, and I don't see how that helps. 
But does that really make up for war crimes? I see in the sidebar that we aren't allowed to talk about his drone strikes, so I guess I won't, but what about his persecution of whistler blowers? Bradley Manning, Edward Snowden being the ones everyone has heard about. One thing that really pisses me off isn't Obama, it was the Bush Administration.

&gt;The __Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993__, Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488 (November 16, 1993), codified at [42 U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_42_of_the_United_States_Code) [§ 2000bb](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000bb.html) through [42 U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_42_of_the_United_States_Code) [§ 2000bb-4](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000bb-4.html) (also known as __RFRA__), is a 1993 [United States federal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_law) aimed at preventing laws that substantially burden a person's free exercise of their [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion). The [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law\)) was introduced by [Howard McKeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_McKeon) of [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) and [Dean Gallo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Gallo) of [New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey) on March 11, 1993.  The bill was passed by a unanimous [U.S. House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House) and a near unanimous [U.S. Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Senate) with three dissenting votes  and was signed into law by President [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton). It was held unconstitutional as applied to the states in the *[City of Boerne v. Flores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Boerne_v._Flores)* decision in 1997, which ruled that the RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress's enforcement power. But it continues to be applied to the federal government, for instance in *[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._O_Centro_Espirita_Beneficente_Uniao_do_Vegetal)*, because Congress has broad authority to carve out exemptions from federal laws and regulations that it itself has authorized. In response to City of Boerne v. Flores, some individual states passed [State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Acts) that apply to state governments and local municipalities.

&gt;It is a dark time for America. Freedom is being crushed by the iron fist of our führer, Barack Obama. Across the land are heard the cries of those who finally have affordable health care, covering even their preëxisting conditions, those who once again have jobs, and food on the table, those who, despite their greatest fears, still have their guns.
&gt;
&gt;But the tyrant Obama has finally crossed the line, finally done the unthinkable: He delayed the Affordable Care Act’s employer insurance mandate – _just like Hitler._
&gt;
&gt;Our champion, JOHN ANDREW BOEHNER, is handed a sacred duty, as foretold in the founding prophecy known as the Constitution: Impeachment. For only he, the Speaker, may hold that mighty weapon. When a lawless, tyrannical president imposes his will on the nation, it is the Speaker’s duty, his obligation, his _sacred honor_ to wield this weapon against the forces of tyranny. Facing this duty, JOHN ANDREW BOEHNER stood tall, and declared: “Screw that. Someone could get hurt.”
&gt;
&gt;Instead, he’s going to sue. _Sue him! It’s the American way!_ A lawsuit will send the tyrant back to Kenya! Delaying the employer insurance mandate was so egregious, so Hitlerian, that last summer, the House passed a bill to delay the employer insurance mandate. The president has gone too far this time!
&gt;
&gt;The full House will pass the lawsuit resolution on a party-line vote before the August recess. The lawyers should have things filed around the end of September – just in time for a non-stop lawsuit news cycle until the November election.
&gt;
&gt;Never mind the country’s crumbling infrastructure, or the vanishing Highway Trust Fund. Never mind the abuses at the NSA, or systemic problems at the VA. Never mind rising sea levels, or the growing environmental cost of energy production, or income disparity, or the growing prison population, or refugees at the border. Never mind any of that, because JOHN ANDREW BOEHNER is laser-focused on what’s really important to the country – _nothing getting done_ – never leaving behind his famous battle cry, **_“Hell no, you can’t!”_**

&gt;The Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former diplomat and far right-winger [Alan Keyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Keyes) to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. Keyes, a [conservative Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_conservatism) from Maryland, faced an uphill battle. First, Keyes had few ties to Illinois political leaders. Second, the lack of an opponent allowed Obama to campaign throughout the more conservative downstate regions to build up name recognition. Third, Keyes was seen as a [carpetbagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger), only establishing legal residency in [Calumet City, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calumet_City,_Illinois) days before running. The *[Chicago Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune)* in an [editorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editorial), stated that ""Mr. Keyes may have noticed a large body of water as he flew into [O'Hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport). That is called [Lake Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan).""  In 2000, Keyes attacked [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton) for running for US Senator from New York even though she had never lived there, calling her a carpetbagger.  Keyes attacked Barack Obama for voting against a bill that would have outlawed a form of late-term abortion.

&gt; Fox News Channel commentator Juan Williams says that the Tea Party movement emerged from the ""ashes"" of Ron Paul's 2008 presidential primary campaign.[88] Indeed, Ron Paul has stated that its origin was, on December 16, 2007, when supporters held a, 24 hour record breaking, ""moneybomb"" fundraising event on the Boston Tea Party's 234th anniversary,[89] but that others, including Republicans, took over and changed some the movement's core beliefs.[90][91] Writing for Slate.com, Dave Weigel has argued in concurrence that, in his view, the ""first modern Tea Party events occurred in December 2007, long before Barack Obama took office, and they were organized by supporters of Rep. Ron Paul"", with the movement expanding and gaining prominence in 2009.

As for what parts of the ACA were written to appease Republicans, in addition to basing it on a Republican proposal, and the lack of single-payer and the removal of the public option, as previously mentioned, the ACA actually includes roughly 160 Republican-authored amendments, with the vast majority (over 75 percent) of proposed amendments to the bill accepted. These include allowing health insurance premiums to vary based on participation in employer wellness programs, state grants to evaluate liability reforms, extending dependent coverage to the age of 26, quality control measures, community medical health centers, the ability for states to create their own reforms... and even parts of the ACA that people hate, like the individual mandate, were originally pushed by Republicans like Orrin Hatch and Charles Grassley.

31651,2014-10-04 01:52:24,I am seriously confused by Obama's approval rating. Help me understand.,"Approval rating in the low 40s?  I honestly don't get it.  To me, Obama just doesn't seem all that controversial.  He may be the most middle-of-the-road President since Eisenhower.  

The one big complaint people have voiced in the past, Obamacare, was all sound and fury signifying nothing.  It hasn't had any dire consequences.  It seems a decent, incremental change.  

Everything else he does seems very undramatic, common sense.  What is going on here?

Edit: My original post said 31% approval.  Updated with better numbers per a user comment.  Thx.",2014-10-07 19:13:25,obama,t3_2i8rsu,"The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is both a danger in itself and a wake-up call for Americans – about President Obama, about the institutions of this country and, most important, about ourselves.

There was a time when an outbreak of a deadly disease overseas would bring virtually unanimous agreement that our top priority should be to keep it overseas. Yet Barack Obama has refused to bar entry to the United States by people from countries where the Ebola epidemic rages, as Britain has done.

The reason? Refusing to let people with Ebola enter the United States would conflict with the goal of fighting the disease. In other words, the safety of the American people takes second place to the goal of helping people overseas.

As if to emphasize his priorities, President Obama has ordered thousands of American troops to go into Ebola-stricken Liberia, disregarding the dangers to those troops and to other Americans when the troops return.

What does this say about Obama?

At a minimum, it suggests that he takes his conception of himself as a citizen of the world more seriously than he takes his role as president of the United States. At worst, he may consider Americans’ interests expendable in the grand scheme of things internationally. If so, this would explain a lot of his foreign policy disasters around the world, which seem inexplicable otherwise.

Those critics who have been citing Barack Obama’s foreign policy fiascoes and disasters as evidence that he is incompetent may be overlooking the possibility that he has different priorities than the protection of the American people and America’s interests as a nation.

This is a monstrous possibility. But no one familiar with the history of the 20th century should consider monstrous possibilities as things to dismiss automatically. Nor should anyone who has followed Barack Obama’s behavior over his lifetime, and the values that behavior reveals.

A few critics who, early on, sensed something un-American, if not anti-American, in Barack Obama succumbed to the idea that he was not a native-born citizen. That claim blew up in their faces.

Nor was birthplace crucial anyway. People born overseas have put their lives on the line to defend America, and scientists who escaped from Europe in the 1930s played a major role in creating the nuclear bomb that made the United States a superpower. Conversely, the country’s most notorious traitor – Benedict Arnold – was born on American soil.

Whatever the reason, or combination of reasons, that led to President Obama’s foreign-policy disasters around the world – with the crowning disaster of all, a nuclear Iran, looming on the horizon – it cannot be a simple lack of knowledge or experience. Various former members of the Obama administration are telling the same story, of information and advice from knowledgeable and experienced officials being ignored by this vain and headstrong man.

Back in the 18th century, Edmund Burke pointed out that, whatever the institutions of government, most of the outcomes of what it does “must depend upon the exercise of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightness of ministers of state.”

What did the American voters know about the prudence and uprightness of this untried man they elected president, as a result of his glib rhetoric and his racial symbolism? It is not just bad luck when a reckless gamble turns out disastrously.

No one knows at this point how big the Ebola danger may turn out to be. But what we do know is that official reassurances about this and other dangers have become worthless.

The erosion of constitutional government over the years has become, under the Obama administration, a deluge of arbitrary edicts and defiant lawlessness protected by a grossly politicized Department of Justice.

It may be time to consider reorganizing the institutions of government, so that high officials who try to reassure the public about medical crises are not officials who serve “at the pleasure of the president.” Nor should the attorney general, whose duty is to enforce the laws, be part of an administration whose law-breakers the Justice Department can protect from prosecution.",-2,[],[],['Barack Obama']

EDIT: Phun phacts ""54 percent of Democratic statements were rated as ""mostly true"" or ""true,"" compared to just 18 percent of Republican statements.""   Strange, eh?

That's a fishing expedition for *all* the hot ""scandal"" issues the Republicans can come up with.   These are all of them.  They've had 6 years and the total number of lies is pretty wee and unrelated to actions and policies actually implemented by the government.  No crisis has come from *any* of these ... even though they *desperately* wanted them.

All of them are inconsequential to *anything* in government policy.

Republicans have decided that lying is its own art.  

They're just better are it:  ObamaCare was lied about (and has now succeeded anyway), to We The People's benefit.  Benghazi was lied about (and has disappeared as any concern except their non-funding fault).  The VA was lied about (and its failure traced to their cuts).  Their wars and their tax-cut-giveaways-to-gamblers were lied about.

The bank bailouts were lied about (George W. Bush did them).

The Pentagon budgets were lied about (because Cheney said deficits didn't matter).

Their legacy in Iraq and its cost was lied about (because ISIS was spawned directly from where we destroyed the stable power).

The last biggest legacy are a bunch of ""I'm not a scientist"" deniers who feel they are still entitled to overrule all others.

In short, they claim to rule the entire world, able to punish every other country, any person, any newspaper or TV station and the GOP claims to have authority over two other areas of government (Executive branch and Senate chamber) ... and are surprised when they are stopped.  

So they shut down the government ... over and over and over ... and demand ""cooperation"" with nothing on the table but their ideas alone.

The one exception that comes to mind is when Gorbachev asked him to revive the ""zero option"" that Reagan had proposed for removing short and medium range nuclear weapons from Europe.

So the bottom line is that Reagan appears to have avoided the topic of AIDS not because he was afraid of the disease or because he thought gays were icky, but because his staff didn't like the way the issue played politically.

In the end, there have been more than half a million Americans have died of AIDS, many of them because the Reagan administration actively discouraged an effective response for at least 4 years.

That Republicans can say this with a straight face is always so astounding, considering who was in *before* Obama. George W. Bush, who rushed to war with worthless intel, costing several trillion dollars; who ballooned the national debt with a special tax cut only for the very rich; and who completely bungled the response to terrorism. One only need to look at some basic economic graphs to see how badly off the country was off during Bush and how much we have recovered.

Anyone with a 401(k) or an IRA or a mutual fund or two can look at their balance today and see it is two or three times what it was when Bush left office, when unemployment was spiking at nearly 1 million lost jobs a month.

This is a profoundly ignorant comment made by someone who obviously has no understanding of the healthcare marketplace. You're doing nothing but spouting libertarian magical-thinking nonsense.

Private insurance companies have been using negotiated rates for healthcare services since the 1940s. As time has passed, negotiated rates control market prices. So there haven't been ""market-based pricing mechanisms"" for decades (note that you incorrectly referred to these as ""market pricing mechanism,"" only underscoring your ignorance). Medicare simply adopted what was already in the marketplace, but much more efficiently, which is why all major private insurers now mimic the Medicare negotiated rate strategy, but not as efficiently.

The only time this is not done efficiently is with prescription drug pricing, the so-called ""Medicare Part D,"" which has no negotiated rates. That's because the George W. Bush Administration discarded what has worked in favor of a giant giveaway for big pharma.

You mean the ""don't force people to do things against their will"" nonsense?  You mean the ""live and let live"" nonsense?  Your entire worldview is build on thuggery and force against your fellow citizens.  You're repulsive.

&gt; Private insurance companies have been using negotiated rates for healthcare services since the 1940s. 

That's right, they have.  But what they didn't do is have the strong arm of the government involved *forcing* pricing to be at particular levels.  You'll note that the word ""negotiated"" implies that the parties enter in to the agreement *voluntarily* unlike the case of government's forceful extraction of tax monies to pick up the tab for your left progressive healthcare wetdreams.  Again, you advocate force, you are repulsive.

&gt; So there haven't been ""market-based pricing mechanisms"" for decades

You're not too smart are you?  Or are you Gruber-smart and trying to consciously retool the language as a distraction from the fact.  ""Negotiated"" means that there is exactly some level of market pricing involved.  Since no one had the use of force at their disposal both buyer and seller of medical services and goods had to reach pricing that was mutually acceptable.  That is exactly a marketplace except, perhaps, in the drool precincts of the left progressives.

&gt;  but much more efficiently

That's a joke.  I'm sure you evil apologists for force can always gin up some obscure edge condition where this might be true for 5 or 10 nanoseconds but the relaity of Medicare/Aid is that it's a dishonest system, rife with corruption an fraud, and full of little games the healthcare system is forced to play to participate.  It's exactly like all other forms of collectivism which breed an elite to oversee the corruption. You're repulsive.

Bush was flatout wrong to push D through, you're right about that.  But you're reasoning is incoherent.  If D is a sweetheart deal for big pharma, why are you no similarly catatonic about the fool Obama's phony healthcare program that is the bigget payoff to the insurers ever?

None of this has anything to do with ISIS.  ISIS is the product of opportunity (Obama's slackjawed stupidity) and a long standing internecine battle for power within various Islamic factions.  It has nothing to do with the Iraq war.


EDIT:  Oh, and I don't remotely hate the drone program.  It's a fine way to help these low rent assassins off the planet.  I object (then and now) to their use in kill US nationals without at least some measure of due process, even if it is in abstentia *unless* there is compelling evidence that there is an immediate risk of their being involved in some murderous act.

&gt; didn't crash the economy with his witless ""war president"" agenda 

The war had nothing to do with the economic collapse.  Neither did Bush.  The economic collapse had been building for decades due to a lot of bad policy decisions compounded by lying, cheating, and stealing (and that was just John Q.

Are you actually this ignorant? Or do you expect people will buy this horseshit? Or are you just delusional?

Simply put, if Bush had not invaded Iraq, there would be no ISIS today. Obama is not the first to say this. Many, many foreign policy experts and heads of state have said this.

Bush's failed Iraq war will go down in history as one of the most colossal strategic mistakes of all time. Bush stuffed the Middle East's dick in a hornet's nest and then bashed it with a stick repeatedly.

Iran and Iraq pre-invasion were a check-and-balance on each other. Iraq had a Sunni government in a predominantly Shia country.

Bush's rushed and failed Iraq war completely upset that balance. It ignited a civil war in Iraq that continues to this day. Bush installed a corrupt Shia government in Iraq (concurrently helping Iran, an enemy of the US). That corrupt Shia government persecuted the Sunni, who formed a variety of militia, many extremely radical, using the arms Bush failed to secure. A hideous and brutal civil war resulted, the Bush Iraq Civil War.

At the same time, Bush completely dropped the ball in Afghanistan, which continued to fester and feed off the instability in Iraq. Terrorists in Afghan watched the US's mistakes in Iraq and learned from them and vice versa, creating goodies like IEDs. Eventually, the failed Bush Afghanistan policy metastasized with the failed Bush Iraq war and created a new mutant hybrid of zombie terrorists in the form of Al Queda in Iraq and now ISIS.

The world will suffer the aftershocks of the failed Bush presidency for decades to come. ISIS is just one of his legacies of failure.

An adult would have doubled the unemployment rate? The deficit ratio? Doubled negative GDP?

&gt;The Dow was under 8000 when Obama took office. Now it's almost 18,000.

That's more than doubled.

&gt; In fact, during the entire 65 years from January, 1948 to January, 2013, there were no months with unemployment over 8%, except for 26 months during the bitter 1981 – 1982 recession

Ah and did he point out that in order to lower unemployment Reagan changed how unemployment was calculated? That prior to that the military wasn't counted in the job force and after it was? Change the denominator by adding a million military ""workers"" and instant lowering of unemployment. He did so many tricks like that in the Fed OMB papers they said they couldn't do historical comparisons before (I forget the exact year) about 1975. Yet here's this guy pulling fake data out of his ass without telling the whole story. 

And what's the complaint? 

&gt;By that measure, what is clear is that Obamanomics has produced the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression

Oh? *This* is the complaint? That we recovered but not as *fast* as some historical metric with completely different circumstances. This is your example of failure? Shit. We recovered from a shit management of blood and treasure, from a war we were lied into, with corruption on a vast scale with billions of dollars lost in nation building of Iraq, ongoing war costs that were kept off the books and unfunded for both war and Vet's health because ""the oil will pay for the invasion"" (wrong) ... recovering from the largest expansion of government in history (DHS) with tons of money spent on X-ray radiation machines that were later junked as useless/harmful going to Chertoff's cronies (and Chertoff)  and this retard is complaining that we didn't recover **fast** enough.

&gt; Michele Bachmann and other conservative Christians were outraged after President Barack Obama mocked their predictions that he was hastening the end of the world.

&gt; &amp;quot;Michele Bachmann actually predicted I would bring about the biblical end of days,&amp;quot; Obama said.

&gt; &amp;quot;I am rarely offended by good humor, especially upon consideration of he context in which it is spoken, but I think what is unnerving about Obama to so many Christians is his consistent mocking of Christianity, the scriptures, the basic Christian message, and even the Judeo-Christian heritage of America,&amp;quot; Gallups said.

For example, I could point out the obvious, the Affordable Care Act, not merely a historic accomplishment, but one that presidents have been trying to accomplish for nearly a century. FDR tried to pass health care reform and failed. Nixon tried to pass health care reform and failed. Clinton tried to pass health care reform and failed. Obama tried, and succeeded.

Now you'll try to say that this wasn't an accomplishment at all. You'll point to one of the tired claims Republicans have been making about the horrors it will unleash (which have pretty much all proven [wrong](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/07/independent-study-finds-republican-prediction-obamacare-wrong.html)). You'll point out how unpopular it is (after six years of a heavily funded smear campaign, and despite that polls show people like what is actually *in* the law). You'll point at how insurance premiums have still risen (at the lowest rate in recorded history).

You'll also ignore how *millions* of people who didn't have access to health care before now do (and don't even try to argue that the emergency room is a viable form of health care in the context we're talking about - it isn't). You'll ignore how one of the major complaints about health care prior to this law, the industry-wide practice of recessions, no longer exists. You'll ignore the lives that this law has already saved.

What about hunting down bin Laden? No doubt, you'll argue that this was all Seal Team Six's doing, and that Obama deserves no credit, despite that he gave the order to go ahead with the mission, which would have been disastrous if it had failed, and he would have taken the blame for it if it had. He made the choice not to communicate an invasive mission into a sovereign government's territory, something that many of his staff (including Joe Biden) argued against. We can now look back and see the wisdom in it - because it's almost certain that the Pakistani army and probably some of their government was fully aware he was there and would have notified him if they were alerted to the mission. But at the time, it was a risky choice, and Obama was the one who made it.

What about the recovery of the economy? The stimulus of course [did](http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/the-recovery-act-worked-in-a-few-easy-charts/) work and [tons](http://www.businessinsider.com/consumer-comeback-2012-10#ixzz29dALv7xS) of statistics show this.

I could point you to the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which Obama championed and later signed into law, ensuring that if an employer discriminates against a woman by paying them less than they pay a man doing the same work, they can't just get away with it because the woman didn't know her paychecks were smaller until the 180-day statute of limitations expired.

There's his [Credit Card ""Bill of Rights""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/33/establish-a-credit-card-bill-of-rights/) which, among other things, ensures that your credit rates can't be arbitrarily increased without a reason.

He signed into law the [Food Safety Modernization Act](http://dailycaller.com/2011/01/04/president-obama-signs-into-law-sweeping-food-safety-bill-expanding-fdas-powers/), so the FDA can issue mandatory recalls on unsafe food.

He signed the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, ending institutionalized discrimination against LGBT military service personnel.

Considering that he's been faced with an opposition party that has gone to *unprecedented* lengths to oppose him, Obama has gotten an *astounding* amount of good work done. This doesn't, of course, mean that I agree with everything he has done (in particular, the actions of the NSA during his term are atrocious), but I do believe that on the whole, he has been a superb president.

The Lilly Ledbetter Act is reverse discrimination. I worked 30 years in a factory employing 2500 workers for two shifts. All of us were paid the... same...exact...wage. But guess what? Every swinging tit woman had the easiest jobs because of their physical weakness. The new female workers were put on easier jobs it took years for older male workers to gain seniority for. They didn't lift steel cages all day. They didn't swing hoists carrying tons of material. No. They had jobs where they could sit on their asses and polish their nails.

Obama is pushing for the legitimacy of Monsanto's GMO at a time when Europe banned them. He has no problem with corporate farming where meat is still being fill up with hormones to increase the size of animals to such a point that viruses are mutating faster than medicine can be developed to counter it. It is a damn shame that he has so little respect for the military that he would repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell, that it defies logic. No soldier I served with would have wanted a flaming faggot in their platoon. Not to mention showering together. Gay people are mentally ill. They are at the most 5% of the population. Instead of accepting them society needs to treat their illness. The American Psychological Association changed their policy toward gays in 1975. Not because they had been wrong all along. But rather, they did so because of political correctness. It just wasn't called that at the time. Gays were demanding change through civil disobedience. That's how the board came to their conclusions. I know, I was a teenager at the time and my father served on a state board of Psychiatry. 
With the exception of Nixon, no opposing party in modern times came close to coming out of the woodwork after a president as they have Clinton and he still got a shit ton more accomplished than Obama by this time and that includes all he when through with the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clinton did so because he was competent and accomplished where Obabam has been a total failure. Obama has carried over the policies of Bush with no shame. Not only has he supported the Patriot Act when he said he would abolish it. He expanded it several times and also expanded America's war machine into Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Yemen. Not even Bush jr did all that shit. Having Joe Biden as an advisor to Getting Bin Laden is not saying much. He is a baffoon on the level of Dan Quail and if he were a Republican he would be getting laughed at daily as Quale endured.
Bin Laden was not a big risk. Not now that we know about Seymore Hersh's report.

No, that's all I was willing to bother with, knowing that you'd just dismiss them. And look, I was right.

&gt; I don't know where you are getting your information on the accomishments about obamacare. 

Well, I did provide you a link to start with, but I know that must be hard for you.

&gt; What ever success you give its popularity stems from so many people being unemployed

Well, 1. Your logic doesn't really make sense, and 2. as xraycatz says, there is a huge difference between unemployment and willful unemployment.

&gt; during Obama's tenure that people are being forced to sign up and are paying more in premiums to do it.

People who aren't employed generally don't make an income. People with an income under the poverty line (hint: it's more than zero) are not penalized in any way for not getting health insurance. So clearly unemployment isn't a factor here, since the unemployed don't have to buy insurance at all.

&gt; The only reason obamacare succeeded at all is because our country has moved toward socialism with the ideals of fascism.

The scriptures of Limbaugh, Hannity, and O'Reilly have spoken!

&gt;  Just look how Obama has not reversed the Trent toward militarism of our police.

Wow... you not only misspelled ""trend"", but then inexplicably capitalized it. At least, I *think* that's what you did. We're not talking about a guy named Trent, are we?

Also, weren't you just complaining about fascism? What do you expect Obama to do? Make a binding regal decree that all city, state, and county police forces must obey? Do you even know how government *works*?

&gt; Whith his blessings the military has been manning checkpoints with police.

For someone who claims to have retired at 49, you seem to have spelling and grammar that would make a high school English teacher tsk.

Also, [citation needed]

&gt; That is fine with you as long as the president is not Republican.

Did you even read what I wrote? Clearly not. So for your sake, I'll copy-paste it:

&gt; This doesn't, of course, mean that I agree with everything he has done (in particular, the actions of the NSA during his term are atrocious), but I do believe that on the whole, he has been a superb president.

See, I am capable of thinking he's mostly done a good job, while still strongly disagreeing with some of the things he's done. Maybe you're incapable of nuance, but I don't live in a world of black and white with no grays.

&gt; The economy is recovering for Wall Street. Not for common workers. Where jobs are being created they are mostly low wage.

You get to complain about this when Obama can actually pass his budget, rather than having to negotiate with Republicans on theirs.

&gt; The Lilly Ledbetter Act is reverse discrimination.

This is astoundingly stupid for multiple reasons. Firstly, because there's no such thing as ""reverse discrimination"". Discrimination against whites or men isn't ""reverse"" anything, it is just simply discrimination. It doesn't need a new or ""reverse"" term, it's the same damn thing.

Secondly, the law in question deals with gender-biased discrimination. That works both ways. If you find out all the ladies with the same skills and experience as you make more than you, you have just as much right to make use of it.

&gt; All of us were paid the... same...exact...wage.

I don't know... why you need... the... ellipses...

Also, this is rather unusual - most employers do not make known how much they pay their workers.

&gt; Every swinging tit woman had the easiest jobs because of their physical weakness.

Wow.

Okay, first of all, I think just using that term must qualify you as an asshole. Second of all, if women at your job were given easier work for the same pay, that is something you could have potentially sued for.

&gt; The new female workers were put on easier jobs it took years for older male workers to gain seniority for. They didn't lift steel cages all day. They didn't swing hoists carrying tons of material. No. They had jobs where they could sit on their asses and polish their nails. It is total bullshit and one of the reasons I retired at 49 after 31 years of employment rather than wait until my body was broken to collect Social Security.

Again, if this is true (and you'll forgive me if I don't consider you a reputable source), this is actionable. However, even if it were true, it would also be *anecdotal*, and really has nothing to do with the law in question.

&gt; The FSMA is little more than word games played on the American people. He increases regulations on some items and turns his eyes on more important issues because is is a corporate hack masquerading as the champion of the people. Obama is pushing for the legitimacy of Monsanto's GMO at a time when Europe banned them. He has no problem with corporate farming where meat is still being fill up with hormones to increase the size of animals to such a point that viruses are mutating faster than medicine can be developed to counter it.

I'm not even going to argue about this, because even if it were all true, it wouldn't change what he's accomplished, which is what we're actually talking about.

&gt; It is a damn shame that he has so little respect for the military that he would repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell, that it defies logic. No soldier I served with would have wanted a flaming faggot in their platoon.

Replace ""gay"" with ""black"" and you have the exact same argument of the generation previous.

Congratulations! You're a bigot.

&gt; Gay people are mentally ill.

This is scientifically, *verifiably* false.

&gt; The American Psychological Association changed their policy toward gays in 1975. Not because they had been wrong all along. But rather, they did so because of political correctness.

That's funny, because [their own webpage](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx) they say it's because:

&gt; Research has found no inherent association between any of these sexual orientations and psychopathology.

So no, not ""political correctness"".

&gt; Instead of accepting them society needs to treat their illness.

The APA has something to say about *this*, as well:

&gt; What about therapy intended to change sexual orientation from gay to straight?

&gt; All major national mental health organizations have officially expressed concerns about therapies promoted to modify sexual orientation. To date, there has been no scientifically adequate research to show that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation (sometimes called reparative or conversion therapy) is safe or effective. Furthermore, it seems likely that the promotion of change therapies reinforces stereotypes and contributes to a negative climate for lesbian, gay and bisexual persons.

So again, wrong.

&gt; I know, I was a teenager at the time and my father served on a state board of Psychiatry.

Well aren't you Mr. Prolific. [Also...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/I-dont-believe-you.gif)

&gt; With the exception of Nixon, no opposing party in modern times came close to coming out of the woodwork after a president as they have Clinton and he still got a shit ton more accomplished than Obama by this time and that includes all he when through with the Monica Lewinsky affair.

Your English is so atrocious here I can't even tell what you're trying to say. Care to try again?

&gt; Clinton did so because he was competent and accomplished where Obabam has been a total failure.

Well, this rules out it being auto-correct's fault.

&gt; Obama has carried over the policies of Bush with no shame. Not only has he supported the Patriot Act when he said he would abolish it. He expanded it several times and also expanded America's war machine into Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Yemen. Not even Bush jr did all that shit.

Again, irrelevant to the topic at hand.

&gt; Having Joe Biden as an advisor to Getting Bin Laden is not saying much.

I don't think what you think I was saying is what I was actually saying. Try reading that again.

&gt; He is a baffoon on the level of Dan Quail and if he were a Republican he would be getting laughed at daily as Quale endured.

You have two different spellings for the man's name, and *both* of them are wrong. It's Quayle.

&gt; Bin Laden was not a big risk.

Aww. You're so cute.

&gt; Not now that we know about Seymore Hersh's report

Certainly a claim worth investigating, but ""worth investigating"" and ""he claims it and thus it must be so"" are two different things entirely.

And again, you've proven me right - you've simply claimed that his accomplishments aren't accomplishments and pointed to other points of contention.

The reason that hatred has grown seems mostly because his administration is not as cozy, is not as corrupt, is not as full of sexual and financial conflicts and full-blown-destructive practices as King George W. Bush's admin nor even Clinton's and GHWB's admins.

IRS targets Obama’s enemies: The IRS targeted conservative and pro-Israel groups prior to the 2012 election.   
  
Benghazi: This is actually three scandals in one:

The failure of administration to protect the Benghazi mission.
The changes made to the talking points in order to suggest the attack was motivated by an anti-Muslim video
The refusal of the White House to say what President Obama did the night of the attack



Watching the AP: The Justice Department performed a massive cull of Associated Press reporters’ phone records as part of a leak investigation.  

  
Rosengate: The Justice Department suggested that Fox News reporter James Rosen is a criminal for reporting about classified information and subsequently monitored his phones and emails.

5. Potential Holder perjury I: Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress he had never been associated with “potential prosecution” of a journalist for perjury when in fact he signed the affidavit that termed Rosen a potential criminal.

6. The ATF “Fast and Furious” scheme: Allowed weapons from the U.S. to “walk” across the border into the hands of Mexican drug dealers. The ATF lost track of hundreds of firearms, many of which were used in crimes, including the December 2010 killing of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.

7. Potential Holder Perjury II: Holder told Congress in May 2011 that he had just recently heard about the Fast and Furious gun walking scheme when there is evidence he may have known much earlier.

8. Sebelius demands payment: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius solicited donations from companies HHS might regulate. The money would be used to help her sign up uninsured Americans for ObamaCare.

9. The Pigford scandal: An Agriculture Department effort that started as an attempt to compensate black farmers who had been discriminated against by the agency but evolved into a gravy train delivering several billion dollars in cash to thousands of additional minority and female farmers who probably didn’t face discrimination.

10. GSA gone wild: The General Services Administration in 2010 held an $823,000 training conference in Las Vegas, featuring a clown and a mind readers. Resulted in the resignation of the GSA administrator.

11. Veterans Affairs in Disney World: The agency wasted more than $6 million on two conferences in Orlando. An assistant secretary was fired.

12. Sebelius violates the Hatch Act: A U.S. special counsel determined that Sebelius violated the Hatch Act when she made “extemporaneous partisan remarks” during a speech in her official capacity last year. During the remarks, Sebelius called for the election of the Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina.

13. Solyndra: Republicans charged the Obama administration funded and promoted its poster boy for green energy despite warning signs the company was headed for bankruptcy. The administration also allegedly pressed Solyndra to delay layoff announcements until after the 2010 midterm elections.

14. AKA Lisa Jackson: Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used the name “Richard Windsor” when corresponding by email with other government officials, drawing charges she was trying to evade scrutiny.

15. The New Black Panthers: The Justice Department was accused of using a racial double standard in failing to pursue a voter intimidation case against Black Panthers who appeared to be menacing voters at a polling place in 2008 in Philadelphia.

16. Waging war all by myself: Obama may have violated the Constitution and both the letter and the spirit of the War Powers Resolution by attacking Libya without Congressional approval.

17. Biden bullies the press: Vice President Biden’s office has repeatedly interfered with coverage, including forcing a reporter to wait in a closet, making a reporter delete photos, and editing pool reports.

18. AKPD not A-OK: The administration paid millions to the former firm of then-White House adviser David Axelrod, AKPD Message and Media, to promote passage of Obamacare. Some questioned whether the firm was hired to help pay Axelrod $2 million AKPD owed him.

19. Sestak, we’ll take care of you: Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel used Bill Clinton as an intermediary to probe whether former Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.) would accept a prominent, unpaid White House advisory position in exchange for dropping out of the 2010 primary against former Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.).

20. I’ll pass my own laws: Obama has repeatedly been accused of making end runs around Congress by deciding which laws to enforce, including the decision not to deport illegal immigrants who may have been allowed to stay in the United States had Congress passed the “Dream Act.”

21. The hacking of Sharyl Attkisson’s computer: It’s not clear who hacked the CBS reporter’s computer as she investigated the Benghazi scandal, but the Obama administration and its allies had both the motive and the means to do it.

22. An American Political Prisoner: The sudden decision to arrest Nakoula Basseley Nakoula on unrelated charges after protests in the Arab world over his anti-Muslim video is an extraordinarily suspicious coincidence. “We’re going to go out and we’re going to prosecute the person that made that video,” Hillary Clinton allegedly told the father of one of the ex-SEALs killed in Banghazi.

23. Get rid of inconvenient IGs: Corporation for National and Community Service Inspector General Gerald Walpin was fired in 2009 as he fought wasteful spending and investigated a friend of Obama’s, Sacramento Mayor and former NBA player Kevin Johnson. The White House says Walpin was incompetent.

24. Influence peddling: An investigation is underway of Alejandro Mayorkas, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, who has been nominated by Obama for the number two post at the Department of Homeland Security. Mayorkas may have used his position to unfairly obtain U.S. visas for foreign investors in company run by Hillary Clinton’s brother, Anthony Rodham.

Obama has been elected for his second term. His detractors were all claiming that so many things would happen during this second term. How close were they to what actually happened?

1. Gas Would Peak at $5.45 per Gallon Mike Lee (R-UT) claimed that if Obama was reelected, gas would go up to $6.60 per gallon. Lee was not the only one claiming these prices. Republican Newt Gingrich claimed prices could go as high as $10 a gallon. Today’s average gas prices are $2.24 per gallon.

2. Unemployment Would Stay Above 8% Mitt Romney predicted that if Obama was reelected, we would continue to see massive unemployment for a long time to come. At the time, the unemployment rate was 8.1%. Romney claimed if he was elected, he could bring unemployment down to 6%. Today the unemployment rate is 5.8%, lower than what Romney himself thought was the best he could do.

3. Huge Stock Market Crash Donald Trump attacked Obama on Twitter after his reelection, claiming the drop in currency and stock prices was due to Obama. Other experts claimed there would be no end in sight for the dropping prices. At this time, the stock market is currently over 35%, much higher than the 20% claimed by experts at the time.

4. U.S. Economy Collapse Many conservative, like Rush Limbaugh, claimed the U.S. economy would completely collapse if Obama was reelected. Since Obama’s reelection, the economy has been steadily climbing.",6,[],[],['Donald Trump']

On the backs of people who actually work and have to pick up the tab for his crackwhore base.  Leftie Drool #2

Help start multiple companies - with private money.  Created multiple jobs in several countries, all of which resulted in an increased production of tax revenue.

The only thing Obama can run is his big mouth.

Of course, Bush fought two major wars and expanded medicare. Obama also had to spend on those wars, albeit less than Bush. But he also greatly expanded the federal healthcare system.

So Reagan turns out to be the grand champion of wasteful spending. He spent about as much as the other two champion spenders, but citizens received much less health care and war in return.",3,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

It has spent decades influencing politics in favour of the right wing views of its financiers through AstroTurf campaigning (fake grassroots campaigning) and the dissemination of propaganda.

In 2009, a lawsuit reached the Supreme Court. Citizens United were the plaintiffs. The lawsuit was against the Federal Election Commission who had ruled that an ad for a motion picture Citizens United produced called ""Hillary: The Movie"" could not be shown close to an electoral primary as the ad and the movie it promoted were clearly intended solely to influence the outcome of the election (by persuading people not to vote for Hillary Clinton), in violation of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, aka McCain-Feingold. The relevant part of the act prohibits corporations and unions from spending money on electioneering materials within specific windows of elections.

Once the lawsuit reached the Supreme Court, the bounds of the discussion were expanded beyond the narrow initial question of if the movie could legally be shown to whether the restrictions on spending mentioned above violated the 1st Amendment, prohibiting the government from restricting its citizens free speech.

The Court ruled that the restrictions did violate the 1st Amendment, thus essentially equating money with speech on the basis that money is required to disseminate a message effectively (for instance, through TV advertisements). 

The result of this is that organisations like Citizens United are now able to produce and disseminate direct electioneering materials virtually without restriction. This means they can run TV ads directly attacking candidates they (or more accurately, their financial backers) oppose, effectively sidestepping the limits on campaign contributions by funnelling unlimited money into ""independent"" groups directly influencing the election with the same goals as the campaign (ie, to help a specific candidate win rather than simply raising awareness of an issue). The effect of this is essentially a loophole in campaign contribution restrictions, hence the term ""dark money"" - money outside the illuminated and highly regulated campaign finance system.

Obama didn't do anything to it. He was President when the ruling was made, and issued a verbal rebuke to the Supreme Court in his State of the Union speech shortly after it happened. The article here is arguing he should issue an Executive Order effectively restoring the law, but it would be largely symbolic.",2,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

&gt; President Obama attended a Capitol Hill ceremony today to honor the anniversary, and offered some timely and poignant remarks.

&gt; Lest anyone think this was a coincidence, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today, &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m not going to wave you off consideration of the idea that that message stands in quite stark contrast to the rhetoric that we hear from a variety of Republican candidates for president. So I think it&amp;#039;s appropriate for you to notice the difference in those messages, but I would contest the notion that this is something that the president newly inserted into his remarks to respond to one individual.""

&gt; &amp;quot;During remarks at the 150th Anniversary of the 13th Amendment, President Barack Obama reminds the nation that this generation needs to do what the generation in the past did and be accepting of everyone in the U.S.&amp;quot;regardless of what faith they.

&gt; **If Obama Is Reelected**

&gt; *By patriot On October 28, 2012*

&gt; So now it comes to it.  Several years after taking up the mantle of “liberty leader”, the epic battle of our times arrives here.  The moment of truth arrives here.   With all that is at stake, it is an amazing twist of fate that the decision about our country’s future will likely be determined here in our home state of Ohio. It almost seems unreal. But, it is actually happening. Right here, right now.  I am hesitant to impart a message of doom because I do not want to deliver you into the hands of Despair, so I must say that we still have a chance to pull our nation out of the nose dive it is in if Obama wins the election. But, I also owe you the truth. The fact remains that if Barack Obama is elected to a second “lame duck” term as President, we will be severely damaged as a nation – damage that may be impossible to repair.

&gt; Among the many consequences, here are a few that may be expected:

&gt; Expect Obamacare to be fully implemented on a nationwide basis. Obama will have a mandate and Congress will likely comply because of it – even the Republicans. I’ve actually heard this said directly by a current Republican member of the House. Sorry to burst anyone’s bubble with that observation, but it is very tough to rely on DC for principled leadership these days. Yes, there will be a few liberty-minded Republicans who will fight, but there are still far too many RINOs in office.

&gt; If Obama is reelected, expect the establishment of unneeded and free-market killing healthcare “exchanges”; IPAB “death panels”; crushing new taxes; new penalties; the religious-freedom-killing HHS mandate (God only knows the ramifications of that alone – schools, hospitals, and religious organizations potentially closing in droves); tens of millions losing their insurance; insurance companies going out of business; premiums skyrocketing (i.e. because those benefits now “covered at 100%” aren’t really free); healthcare options diminishing; providers being overworked and under compensated – many quitting altogether; fewer medical students; fewer best-and-brightest doctors; less innovation in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and treatments; healthcare rationing through longer waits; rationed access to medical equipment; outright denial of care for seniors, disabled individuals, the chronically infirm, and the very young; not to mention $716 billion “removed” from Medicare…and the list goes on.

&gt; In the end – and as the progressives intended all along – there will be an eventual and complete government takeover of healthcare. One of America’s best hopes for future jobs and opportunity was as an innovator and leader in medical care for the rest of the world. But, no more. That future will be gone. It will have been successfully destroyed by a relatively small handful of committed elitists and their crony friends who somehow managed through some shrewd political calculation and a bit of old-fashioned luck to gain power.

&gt; Of course, this was all never supposed to happen in America, but it has.

&gt; However, it doesn’t stop there.

&gt; If Obama is reelected, expect higher taxes across the board – not only for job creators and high-achievers, but also for the “middle-class”; and speaking of the middle-class, expect it to shrink dramatically.

&gt; Expect a wider gap between the haves and the have-nots.

&gt; Expect continued and chronically high unemployment.

&gt; Expect small businesses to continue to fail.

&gt; Expect a much larger dependent class.

&gt; Expect less social mobility.

&gt; Expect private property rights of all kinds to diminish.

&gt; Expect to bow before the new apothegm, “You didn’t build that!” Everything you think you own – not just your business – won’t really be yours because it exists as a result of the “collective” which now claims proportionate ownership.

&gt; Expect more food stamp recipients, more welfare, higher energy costs, more inflation, and less prosperity.

&gt; Expect higher yearly deficits and more public debt, easily topping $20 trillion and then some.

&gt; Expect more generational theft from our children and grandchildren. Woe that we were their stewards! The responsibility for having so devastated their futures will certainly fall on our shoulders. Go ahead and shout it out loud, “We knowingly stole from our children for our own weakness and irresponsible excess!” There must be a special place in hell for a people who would permit such a dishonorable and immoral thing to happen. But, expect this and more nonetheless.

&gt; Now this is already quite a list of things to expect, but here is one especially evil expectation not so clearly seen by most folks:

&gt; If Obama is reelected, expect business and prosperity-killing regulations from a tyrannical bureaucracy the likes of which has not been seen in our nation since the era of writs and the Intolerable Acts. Under the banner of demagogic initiatives to “protect the environment”, provide “clean air”, “clean water”, “public safety”, “food safety”, “preserve wetlands”, save “endangered species”, improve “public health”, and so on.  Unaccountable czars and leftist agency directors and their legions of new agents will unleash a crushing blow to the foundation of our economy. This onslaught will do untold damage to individual liberty and will be felt across all levels of our society for decades to come. Worse than establishment cronies, these unelected bureaucrats will be the worst sort of unaccountable ideologues. They will seek not only to reward their crony friends, but to intentionally destroy free-market capitalism in America and replace it with a Corporatist economy (i.e. like China). In the process, they will mercilessly shred both our Constitution and our individual rights.

&gt; This regulatory threat is one that some of my liberty-minded friends fail to see with clear eyes. They say, “Politicians in both major parties are crony interventionists. They are all the same no matter who gets elected.” With this rationalization, they proclaim they will “vote on principles” for some third party candidate. Unwittingly they split the conservative vote and drive our nation even more rapidly into the hands of the ideological left. These “libertarians” mean well, but they achieve the opposite of their hearts’ desires and become their own worst enemies. Better to vote on principle in the primary, and then, as Bill Buckley used to say, “(vote) for the most conservative candidate who can win” in the general. Let us hope enough of them figure this out in time.

&gt; Further, if Obama is reelected, expect more leftist judges.

&gt; Also, expect freedom on the Internet to be squelched and freedom of speech in general to become more endangered. Be mindful that if freedom of speech is finally destroyed, this is the last nail in America’s coffin. With the death of free speech, both our liberty and our Republic will die as one.

&gt; So, there are now fewer than 10 days till Election Day. Our course looking forward is clear:

&gt; - We must do our best to elect new leadership for our nation from the current slate of candidates.

&gt; - In time, we must work to see waves of principled candidates elected to office at all levels of government.

&gt; - We must build lasting coalitions on a local level to support candidates that will protect our liberty now and in the future.

&gt; - We must work to take more responsibility for being informed as citizens and for holding government accountable.

&gt; - We must help build a new media and cease our reliance on the biased mainstream media that has done so much damage to our country in the past.

&gt; - Finally, we must make a firm commitment to carry on our study of liberty and spread the message of freedom to others.

&gt; Now is the final push to the finish. We must reach out to our neighbors in person, online, and by phone, and do all we can to get like-minded voters to the polls. If you haven’t done so yet, obtain a walk-list and literature to pass out in your area, learn how you can make calls to voters from home, get material to hand out at the polls on Election Day, and more – at this link [removed].

&gt; Whatever the future holds, let us each earn the right to take refuge in the knowledge that we did all we could do to save ",2016-01-06 23:38:46,obama,t3_3zru6h,"&gt; Expect Obamacare to be fully implemented on a nationwide basis.

It already was?

&gt; Obama will have a mandate

Not that Republicans in Congress would ever admit to it.

&gt; and Congress will likely comply because of it – even the Republicans.

Ha.

&gt; I’ve actually heard this said directly by a current Republican member of the House.

Repeating someone else's shitty prediction does not get you off the hook for saying it.

&gt; If Obama is reelected, expect the establishment of unneeded and free-market killing healthcare “exchanges”;

And yet, the free market health insurers continue to exist.

&gt; IPAB “death panels”;

I actually addressed this claim in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx?context=5#c530lfx) about the contents of the Affordable Care Act. I said the following:

**What about the Independent Medicare Advisory Board? Death Panels!**: The Independent Medicare Advisory Board (which has had its name changed to Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB) is intended to give recommendations on how to save Medicare costs per person, deliver more efficient and effective care, improve access to services, and eliminate waste. However, they have no real power. They put together a recommendation to put before Congress, and Congress votes on it, and the President has power to veto it. What's more, they are specifically told that their recommendation will not ration health care, raise premiums or co-pays, restrict benefits, or restrict eligibility. In other words, they need to find ways to save money without reducing care for patients. So no death panels. In any sense of the (stupid) term. ( Citation: Page 426, sec. 3403 )

&gt; crushing new taxes;

The most significant rise in taxes for anyone was on January 13, 2013 when, after negotiating with Congress during one of their ""fiscal cliff"" crises, the Bush tax cuts for those making over $400,000 a year were allowed to go back up to what they were during the Clinton years. Republicans would no doubt argue that this was ""crushing"", though I doubt many would agree with them. Of course, Obama doesn't get credit for *renewing* the tax cuts on everyone making *under* $400,000.

&gt; new penalties;

That's so vaguely-written you could apply it to damn near anything.

&gt; the religious-freedom-killing HHS mandate (God only knows the ramifications of that alone – schools, hospitals, and religious organizations potentially closing in droves);

The mandate did go into effect. But the predicted negative repercussions resulting from it have yet to be seen in any significant fashion.

&gt; tens of millions losing their insurance;

FactCheck.org says [2.6 million](http://www.factcheck.org/2014/04/millions-lost-insurance/) had policies discontinued, and most of those simply got a new policy, in many cases one that was better. Conversely, [16.4 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/obamacare-adds-164-million-to-health-insurance-rolls/2015/03/16/01fff554-cbf3-11e4-8a46-b1dc9be5a8ff_story.html) people who didn't have insurance before now do.

&gt; insurance companies going out of business;

Ha. No.

&gt; premiums skyrocketing (i.e. because those benefits now “covered at 100%” aren’t really free);

Since the Affordable Care Act passed, insurance premiums have been rising at the slowest rate ever recorded.

&gt; healthcare options diminishing;

This of course depends on who you ask, but generally speaking not really in any significant way.

&gt; providers being overworked and under compensated – many quitting altogether;

Depends what you consider ""overworked"", ""under compensated"" and ""many"" to mean. Largely though, no.

&gt; fewer medical students;

The ACA specifically sets aside funds for *more* medical students. This claim doesn't really make sense.

&gt; fewer best-and-brightest doctors;

Again, argumentative. But largely, no.

&gt; less innovation in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and treatments;

Again, argumentative.

&gt; healthcare rationing through longer waits;

Has anyone measured this? If they are longer, they aren't noticeably longer.

&gt; rationed access to medical equipment;

Wasn't it always that way, though? It's not like before the ACA, they gave out free X-Rays and CAT scans to everyone.

&gt; outright denial of care for seniors, disabled individuals, the chronically infirm, and the very young;

Yeah, that's just bullshit.

&gt; not to mention $716 billion “removed” from Medicare…

I dealt with this claim before too. I said:

**Obamacare cuts $700 Billion dollars from Medicare!**: Not really. What the Affordable Care Act actually does is brings Medicare Advantage costs back in line with regular Medicare ( Citation: Page 384, Sec. 3201 and Page 389, Sec. 3202 ), limit the growth of certain parts of Medicare where our spending is outpacing what we're actually required to spend ( Citation: Page 426, Sec. 3402 ), and replaces some parts of Medicare with better, more cost-effective substitutes ( Citation: Page 361, Sec. 3112 ). These accusations are based on a report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office showing the reduction of Medicare costs from 2012-2022. However, the accusations fail to mention that those ""cuts"" will not result in reduced care, reduced enrollment, or reduced anything really, other than reduced costs to the taxpayers... which both Democrats and Republicans agree is a good idea (so much so that Republicans like Paul Ryan even included those exact same ""cuts"" in their own budget plans).

&gt; In the end – and as the progressives intended all along – there will be an eventual and complete government takeover of healthcare.

If it ever does happen, it won't be any time soon.

&gt; One of America’s best hopes for future jobs and opportunity was as an innovator and leader in medical care for the rest of the world.

The healthcare industry as a whole accounts for only about 11% of all employment. For comparison, Wal-Mart alone employs 1% of America. So maybe this isn't the holy grail it's being billed as.

&gt; If Obama is reelected, expect higher taxes across the board

Didn't he already make this claim?

&gt; not only for job creators and high-achievers, but also for the “middle-class”;

Not only is it presumptuous to call the wealthy ""job creators"" and ""high achievers"", but no, the middle class has not seen a significant rise in taxes.

&gt; and speaking of the middle-class, expect it to shrink dramatically. Expect a wider gap between the haves and the have-nots.

This has been happening since Reagan was in office. Obama hasn't made it worse, or really better for that matter.

&gt; Expect continued and chronically high unemployment.

Unemployment is steady at a nice, low 5%

&gt; Expect small businesses to continue to fail.

Not really.

&gt; Expect a much larger dependent class.

Argumentative.

&gt; Expect less social mobility.

Again, been happening since Reagan.

&gt; Expect private property rights of all kinds to diminish.

This is the old line Republicans always use. It's no more true now than it was then.

&gt; Expect to bow before the new apothegm, “You didn’t build that!”

Ah, rhetoric.

&gt; Everything you think you own – not just your business – won’t really be yours because it exists as a result of the “collective” which now claims proportionate ownership.

Hmm.... nope, I still own the things I own.

&gt; **If Obama Is Reelected**

&gt; *By patriot On October 28, 2012*

&gt; So now it comes to it.  Several years after taking up the mantle of “liberty leader”, the epic battle of our times arrives here.  The moment of truth arrives here.   With all that is at stake, it is an amazing twist of fate that the decision about our country’s future will likely be determined here in our home state of Ohio. It almost seems unreal. But, it is actually happening. Right here, right now.  I am hesitant to impart a message of doom because I do not want to deliver you into the hands of Despair, so I must say that we still have a chance to pull our nation out of the nose dive it is in if Obama wins the election. But, I also owe you the truth. The fact remains that if Barack Obama is elected to a second “lame duck” term as President, we will be severely damaged as a nation – damage that may be impossible to repair.

&gt; Among the many consequences, here are a few that may be expected:

&gt; Expect Obamacare to be fully implemented on a nationwide basis. Obama will have a mandate and Congress will likely comply because of it – even the Republicans. I’ve actually heard this said directly by a current Republican member of the House. Sorry to burst anyone’s bubble with that observation, but it is very tough to rely on DC for principled leadership these days. Yes, there will be a few liberty-minded Republicans who will fight, but there are still far too many RINOs in office.

&gt; If Obama is reelected, expect the establishment of unneeded and free-market killing healthcare “exchanges”; IPAB “death panels”; crushing new taxes; new penalties; the religious-freedom-killing HHS mandate (God only knows the ramifications of that alone – schools, hospitals, and religious organizations potentially closing in droves); tens of millions losing their insurance; insurance companies going out of business; premiums skyrocketing (i.e. because those benefits now “covered at 100%” aren’t really free); healthcare options diminishing; providers being overworked and under compensated – many quitting altogether; fewer medical students; fewer best-and-brightest doctors; less innovation in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and treatments; healthcare rationing through longer waits; rationed access to medical equipment; outright denial of care for seniors, disabled individuals, the chronically infirm, and the very young; not to mention $716 billion “removed” from Medicare…and the list goes on.

&gt; In the end – and as the progressives intended all along – there will be an eventual and complete government takeover of healthcare. One of America’s best hopes for future jobs and opportunity was as an innovator and leader in medical care for the rest of the world. But, no more. That future will be gone. It will have been successfully destroyed by a relatively small handful of committed elitists and their crony friends who somehow managed through some shrewd political calculation and a bit of old-fashioned luck to gain power.

&gt; Of course, this was all never supposed to happen in America, but it has.

&gt; Expect more food stamp recipients, more welfare,

When Obama took office, it was during a recession. Of course food stamp recipients and welfare was high - everyone had just lost their jobs during the Bush administration. But at the same time, it's ridiculous to think that years later these numbers would actually go *up*.

&gt; higher energy costs,

Gas is at ridiculously low prices right now.

&gt; more inflation, 

No more than usual, which is good for a healthy economy.

&gt; and less prosperity.

""... And there will be less justice, freedom, and other things that can't really be quantified so I can keep saying them as much as I want without being definitively disproved no matter what happens!""

&gt; Expect higher yearly deficits

The deficits have been continually dropping. Again, kinda' to be expected, since we had to pump money into the economy during the height of the recession to keep it from spiraling into a depression.

&gt; and more public debt,

Well, duh. Public debt has gone up virtually every year America has existed.

&gt; easily topping $20 trillion and then some.

This isn't a prediction. It was projected. And much of this can be attributed to the wars started by Bush, and the recession that began during Bush's term. Romney being elected in 2012 would have seen the same rise in national debt. Possibly worse.

&gt; Expect more generational theft from blah blah blah rhetoric rhetoric rhetoric.

And how!

&gt; If Obama is reelected, expect business and prosperity-killing regulations from a tyrannical bureaucracy the likes of which has not been seen in our nation since the era of writs and the Intolerable Acts.

Not really. Regulations continue as normal.

&gt; Under the banner of demagogic initiatives to “protect the environment”, provide “clean air”, “clean water”, “public safety”, “food safety”, “preserve wetlands”, save “endangered species”, improve “public health”, and so on.

Again, nothing noteworthy. Oh, now fast food chains need to list the amount of calories in their foods. Terrible! Shocking!

&gt; Unaccountable czars and yay more rhetoric!

Wheeee!

&gt; Further, if Obama is reelected, expect more leftist judges.

No new supreme court judges have been appointed since 2010, and Republicans in Congress have been holding up the appointment of judges in various other appointments. So no, not really.

&gt; Also, expect freedom on the Internet to be squelched and freedom of speech in general to become more endangered.

Actually, the FCC adopted Net Neutrality rules that ensure that my web provider can't block web traffic simply because of who made it, so free speech online has become a great deal *more* secure, not less. To give you an idea, before this change happened, it was very likely that Comcast would start throttling bandwidth so that services like Netflix wouldn't work properly, because of course Comcast can't lose their cable customers to a superior web service now, can they? Well, now Comcast can't decide what you use your internet connection for - that's your choice.

&gt; Be mindful that if freedom of speech is finally destroyed...

What we need is 100% national vote by mail. 

Look at the 2014 elections, nationally a voter turn out that was abyssmal. 36.4%, lowest since 1942.

But in the states that are 100% vote by mail?

Oregon - 70.9%

Colorado - 54.5%

Washington - 54.16%  
http://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/voter-participation.aspx

So how does this work?

Easy. About a month before election day you get a Voter's Pamphlet in the mail, sometimes more than one depending on how many candidates, ballot measures, etc. 

The pamphlet has arguments for and against all the candidates and issues so you can decide how to vote before your actual ballot arrives in the mail.

About 2 weeks before election day, your ballot arrives. 

After you vote on the ballot, you place it inside a ""secrecy envelope"" and place that inside the mailing envelope. Sign the back of the mailing envelope, put a stamp on it and send it in.

When the ballot arrives at the local precinct, the signature on the back is compared to the signature on the voter registration. If it matches, the envelope is opened and the ""secrecy envelope"" is set aside for counting on election day.

On election day, all the secrecy envelopes are opened and counted. 

You have up until election day to return your ballot. You can wait until the very last day and return your ballot, postage free, to a ballot drop off location or directly to election headquarters.

People who did not get a ballot in the mail can also vote on provisional ballots, in person, at the precinct headquarters on election day.",1,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

The ones that you tell yourself are usually the most destructive.""",,2016-02-04 23:41:47,obama,t3_446sql,"The idea that the divisiveness is coming from Obama is especially laughable when you look at the bills Republicans filibustered in the early days of 2009, when Obama was fresh in office.

Now, historically, the filibuster was generally used to stop the worst of the worst bills. Rules of Congress were that in the Senate, a bill needed 51 ""Yes"" votes to pass, or 50 votes plus the approval of the Vice President as a tie-breaking vote.

Yeah, Joe Biden has not and will not ever cast such a vote. Why? Because the new norm for any bill Republicans even *mildly* opposed became that the filibuster was used to force a requirement of **60 votes**.

Now, Democrats aren't completely innocent in this - towards the end of Bush's term, they were using the filibuster fairly frequently too, but [nowhere near as much as Republicans in 2009 and onward](http://kurtfstone.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e274553ef017ee8922fe9970d-pi).

[Here](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/cloture_motions/111.htm) is the list of cloture votes for the Congress Obama would be saddled with, indicating issues that the Democratic Senate Majority sought to vote on, and Republicans refused to allow. The filibusters start before Obama is even sworn in.

What bills did they filibuster? Bills that were so horrendous republicans refused to even allow the Senate to vote on them? Well, they're bills like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which ensures that discriminatory actions that continue on a repeat basis (like a smaller monthly paycheck for a female employee) have the statute of limitations renewed with each discriminatory act.

It's bills like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the legislation that voters elected Obama to pass.

It's Obama's nominee for the Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis. She was filibustered on February 13, less than a month after Obama was sworn in.

They filibustered Obama's nomination of lawyer David W. Ogden, as well as two of his economic advisers.

Yeah, they filibustered Obama's picks for Secretary of Labor and two of his financial advisers. Within two months of his election. During a financial crisis.

It gets better. In April 2009, they filibustered Obama's pick for US ambassador to Iraq. Obama's choice? Christopher R. Hill, who had worked as ambassador to various nations under both Clinton and Bush.

Republicans used a tactic meant for only the worst of the worst situations to keep the Senate from voting on an ambassador who had worked in two prior administrations.

All of this was within the first three months of Obama taking office. The ""Obamacare"" fight hadn't started yet, and the fight over the stimulus (again, the plan he was *elected to pass*) had only just begun.

For comparison, Democrats filibustered *one* bill within Bush's first three months in office, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, a law the banking industry spent millions of dollars lobbying for to lock debtors out of declaring bankruptcy.

Now, Republicans may have had gripes with the bills they filibustered, but were they so massive that the entire democratic process should be ground to a halt? The assertion is outright ridiculous.",6,[],[],['Joe Biden']

&gt; President Barack Obama will not attend Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia&amp;#039;s funeral on Saturday, the White House said, adding that Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden will be at the services.

&gt; Obama and first lady Michelle Obama instead will go to the Supreme Court on Friday &amp;quot;To pay their respects to Justice Scalia&amp;quot; while the justice lies in repose in the Great Hall, press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday.

&gt; &amp;quot;The president considered the qualifications and world view and credentials and record of the individual that President Bush put forward and then-Sen. Obama raised some objections,&amp;quot; Earnest said.

*****
&gt; During a visit with voters in Milwaukee on Thursday, Obama said he wasn&amp;#039;t sure where he and wife Michelle Obama would settle down for the long term, but added that they were putting off the decision until daughter Sasha finished at Washington&amp;#039;s Sidwell Friends School in spring 2019.

&gt; The Obamas have also refused to talk about where they will live after their daughter graduates, spurring speculation that they might not return to her hometown of Chicago, where Obama began his political career.

&gt; Most presidents move back to their home states after they leave office, though some start new lives elsewhere; President George W. Bush went back to Texas, but President Clinton moved to New York instead of Arkansas so his wife could run for the Senate.

I say this as someone who *likes* Bernie and who has very good friends who are all-in on his presidential campaign - I very rarely meet a Bernie supporter who doesn't make a great Everest out of every tiny molehill of good news for Bernie, nor do I often meet a Bernie supporter who doesn't leap at every opportunity to fling mud at Hillary, even when there's absolutely zero justification for it.

My own girlfriend, who's strongly in support of Bernie, became furious with me when I pointed out that Hillary Clinton's ""bring them to heel"" quote wasn't about black people, but about gangs. I feel there's virtually no negative claim I could make about Hillary that Bernie supporters *wouldn't* believe.

The sad thing is, while I don't think that Clinton is an ideal person to lead the country, I think it's pretty obvious that she would do so in a manner far closer to the ideals of Bernie Sanders than any of the Republican candidates, who Bernie's supporters seem, by comparison, to show little disdain for, occasionally even signaling a willingness to vote for if Bernie doesn't get the Democratic nomination.

That being said, I don't think you can attribute all of his popularity to racism. This article does, however, raise some good points.

I'm going to copy and paste what I wrote about this in another thread. It's difficult to say why Trump is so popular without better polling. We could analyze the voters themselves, but it doesn't tell you much because [Trumps voters are not particularly ideological](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/09/09/who_are_trumps_supporters.html). There isn't a whole lot that they have in common across the board. Many polls show that Trump has a large base of support [among low-income rural blue collar workers](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/upshot/the-geography-of-trumpism.html?_r=0), but he also has a large base of support [among people with relatively high incomes](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/). In fact, he does well in almost [all Republican demographics](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-four-corners-of-the-gop-donald-trump-owns-three-of-them/). 

The voters are all disaffected, and angry. There is a serious dissatisfaction in the party from voters who feel as if [Republicans have completely ignored them](http://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/5/4/11591386/gop-created-trump). There were a whole clown car full of Republican candidates, none of whom were able to appeal to the Republican voters, except for Trump. People predicted that his extreme statements would get him drummed out of the race early, but it was exactly those statements that got him the nomination. The Republican party has ignored their voters, and then Trump comes in and says outrageous statements that no politician would make. People took this to mean that he is really different from the rest of the party: that he was sincere and means what he says. It doesn't matter **what** Trump is saying:**[it matters that he is saying it](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/psysociety/decoding-trump-mania-the-psychological-allure-of-hating-political-correctness-part-1/)**. 

There is however, good data that links Trumps appeal to authoritarianism. 
( [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/15/i-asked-psychologists-to-analyze-trump-supporters-this-is-what-i-learned/?tid=a_inl),
[Politico](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/donald-trump-2016-authoritarian-213533),
[Vox](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/23/11099644/trump-support-authoritarianism) )

Trump supporters seem to want a strong leader, and to them that means a leader who acts like the rules don’t apply to them. They think that social change is a threat to stability. They want to stop deviation from the norm until things around them settle down and they feel secure, have access to jobs, and feel as if they and their communities have dignity. They want to be a part of something larger. Trump gave them the platform with which to do that.

Before their father Barack was elected to office, Malia and Sasha were 11 and 7 years old. They attended University of Chicago Laboratory School, a highly-esteemed private school in Chicago, Illinois.

#2 Going To School As First Daughters

They currently attend Sidwell Friends School, in Washington D.C. The same private school attended by many other first children, including Chelsea Clinton, Tricia Nixon Cox, and Archibald Roosevelt, to name a few. Vice-President, Joe Biden's grandchildren, also currently attend.

At 7 years old, Sasha was the youngest child to live in the White House since John F. Kennedy, Jr., as an infant, in 1961.

#4 Influential Teens

Both Malia and Sasha were named to Time Magazine's, ""25 Most Influential Teens of 2014"".

#5 Code Names

The Secret Service decided to give them code names for their protection. Malia is Radiance and Sasha is Rosebud.

#6 Bo Obama

President Obama promised his daughters a dog if he won the election in 2009. After he won, the family got a Portuguese Water Dog, which is hypoallergenic, because Malia is allergic to animal dander. His name is Bo.

#7 Staying In Washington

After President Obama's second term is up in 2017, the family has decided to stay in Washington D.C. till Sasha is finished with High School. She currently plays basketball, tennis, and is on the cheerleading squad.

#10 Just Regular Teenage Girls

According to their Father, the Obama sisters, like any other teenage girls, have no interest in being friends with him. You know they love you Barack!

#11 Not Dating Yet

When asked about if his daughters were dating yet, Barack responded, ""No, but I've seen some folks glancing at Malia in ways that made me not happy.""",1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

&gt;The U.S. government debt held by the public largely consists of marketable Treasury securities, such as bills, notes and bonds.  
  
From the public's side, those are not debts. Those are investments. The US debt is being paid back with interest. That interest are returns on investments like bonds, bills and notes.  
  
Some things to remember. The Great Recession was due to totally artificial, crooked financial manipulation coming out of Texas that drained $7,000,000,000,000 from the entire economy. All of Bush's Republican cronies that were millionaires became multi-millionaires, the multi-millionaires became billionaires, the billionaires became multi-billionaires. Meanwhile, US productivity has doubled since then while the per capita income has been flat for two decades.  
  
Obama has had to fight tooth-and-nail for every compromise concession he has managed to get from this Republican Congress. Even so, yes, the US Debt is $19,000,000,000,000 but the GDP is $19,000,000,000,000. You can carry a mortgage on your house, debt, which is several times more than your annual income, yet you are able to handle it since it is less than 30% of your household income. For now, the interest payments on the debt are like a mortgage, manageable.  
  
There are huge looming challenges. The next President is going to see the huge drain from the peak Social Security generation. This is the time that was talked about 40 years ago, where it was 3 working people paying for 1 social security recipient, to 1 person paying for 1 social security recipient.  
  
Obama has had the debt increase a lot but still not as much as George W. Bush added.

&gt; VIENTIANE, Laos - President Barack Obama called off a planned meeting Tuesday with new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, seeking distance from a U.S. ally&amp;#039;s leader during a diplomatic tour that&amp;#039;s put Obama in close quarters with a cast of contentious world figures.

&gt; Obama had said he planned to raise the issue in his first meeting with Duterte, but the Philippine leader insisted he was only listening to his own country&amp;#039;s people.

&gt; Managing Duterte has become a worsening headache for Obama since the Filipino took office on June 30, pledging his foreign policy wouldn&amp;#039;t be constricted by reliance on the U.S. Washington has tried largely to look the other way as Duterte has pursued closer relations with China, a marked shift for the Philippines considering recent tensions over Beijing&amp;#039;s aspirations in the South China Sea.

&gt; WASHINGTON President Barack Obama formally announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Myanmar on Friday by terminating an emergency order that deemed the policies of the former military government a threat to U.S. national security.

&gt; A U.S. Treasury statement said that as a result of the termination of the emergency order the economic and financial sanctions administered by the Department of the Treasury&amp;#039;s Office of Foreign Assets Control were no longer in effect.

&gt; Some members of the U.S. Congress have expressed concerns about the extent and durability of change in Myanmar and introduced legislation seeking to give lawmakers some influence on the process of easing sanctions.

&gt; There&amp;#039;s hardly ever been a more European leader in the White House, and Germany in particular would be well-advised to brace for bumpier transatlantic relations ahead. Barack Obama struck a chord with Germans eight years ago in Berlin, when he promised adoring crowds a sharp break with the Bush era.

&gt; The Obama White House took important decisions on Russia that made life easier in Berlin early on, ending controversial US plans for &amp;quot;Third site&amp;quot; missile defense installations in Central Europe, launching a &amp;quot;Reset&amp;quot; of relations with Moscow, and backing off Bush administration plans to enlarge NATO eastward.

&gt; Over the recommendations of top advisors, Obama then chose not to offer Ukraine lethal military aid, sparing Berlin a likely European crackup.

There is no natural end to a term with a PM. There certainly aren't any term limits. If your party is in power for some time then there will inevitably be some jealousies because it was a team effort that got you there. And it's a parliamentary system. Your party can by its own rules replace you. If they think there's a following wind for knocking you off you're gone. 

Prior to the last election David Cameron announced he was going to stand down at the end of the next five year term. Very odd thing to do. I don't ever recall that happening before. They've stood down, but they've never put a public limit on themselves. But then in his mind he was going to be the Tory PM that finally ended the internal civil war over EU membership.

&gt;First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 (hence the steady drop). In 2008, the deficit was $458 billion, or 3.1 percent of GDP. Those deficits are smaller than the ones the country is facing today. The 2009 fiscal year represented a huge jump in the deficit, partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy.

President Barack Obama: ""I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action. And we will, at a time and a place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. But Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it.""

The CIA has accused Russia of intervening, and President Obama has ordered a review of Russia’s role.

That means the cost to the taxpayer was not measured in this program, but in the related lost jobs and opportunity costs connected with that.

Either way, considering the alternative (real depression, bread lines, etc. a very real risk), TARP itself seems a relatively small price to pay to stop the bleeding.

The real problem is that jobs did not come back all too quickly.  Ironically, the people decided after 8 years that this was Obama's fault, when FDR actually succeeded in getting more jobs to people by heading more strongly in the direction of socialism.

""Former President Barack Obama""

Let me explain. First of all, is it really necessary to mention ""president"" at all? There can't possibly be that many Barack Obamas in the world, and I'm pretty sure just about everyone knows who this guy is. I mean, maybe if you just had ""Obama"" without a first name, then you'd need the title to distinguish him from Michelle and their daughters, but no, ""Barack"" is right there.

Maybe for some reason you want to make absolutely sure he's not confused with any Barack Obama, past, present, or future. Okay... then why not just ""President Obama""? Correct me if I'm wrong, but there's only been one, right? I mean, I suppose it's entirely possible Michelle will run at some point, but still...

Okay, so maybe ""President"" is a formality, a form of respect? Well, if that's the case, why ""Former""? A president keeps their title for life, even after they have served their full two terms. President Bush is still President Bush, president Clinton is still president Clinton. When Donald Trump leaves office, he will still be President Trump. There's no ""former"". ""Former"" disrespects the office and his service to the country. When a military general retires, he's still a general. It works the same way with a president.

The only way ""Former President Barack Obama"" makes any sense is if you assume your audience somehow doesn't know who Barack Obama is, and that they are so out of touch with reality that they don't realize he's no longer the sitting president. Otherwise, President Obama or Barack Obama are perfectly sufficient.",0,['Barack Obama'],[],"['Barack Obama', 'Donald Trump']"

I think he truly believed that working together for the greater good of his country would be met with like minded consideration. He was dead wrong. He did not see racism for what it really was... from the  opposing side as well as within his own party... and he was scared sh**less of faux news  and its continuous barking.

They're idealists and idealists have this idea that all people think like them and want the greater good. What they don't realize are that there are people who are only out for themselves and also people who just like to see others do worse than themselves. Obama either failed to realize this or wanted to suspend his belief because he really didn't want to make enemies. I mean he does come off as being a bit too nice for politics and honestly he was. Politics is by its nature adversarial and Obama either wanted to deny that fact or change it. In the end that fact still stands. 

That said I am a huge fan of Obama but I have no problem admitting he was naïve about certain things and definitely not politically aggressive enough. Though some part of that may have been due to his not wanting to be stereotyped as an angry black man which I as a minority person myself can understand. ",3,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

Full quote:

&gt; English: United States President Barack Obama shoots clay targets on the range at Camp David, Maryland on Saturday, 4 August 2012. The side jet of smoke is from holes in the ported gun barrels.

&gt; Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on 14 December 2012, Obama argued for tighter gun controls in the United States. In an interview in the New Republic on 27 January 2013, Obama was asked ""Have you ever fired a gun?"" and he replied, ""Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.""

&gt; Following the interview, the White House released this picture on Flickr on 1 February 2013 at 6.25 PM PST, and the following day the White House Press Secretary released it on his Twitter account.

&gt; Senate Republicans (under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) refused to consider Garland's nomination, holding ""no hearings, no votes, no action whatsoever"" on the nomination.[87][88] The refusal was highly controversial, with some commentators saying the seat on the Court to which Garland was nominated was ""stolen"".[89][90][91] Over 170,000 people signed a White House petition asking President Obama to independently appoint Garland to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Senate had waived its advise and consent role.

&gt; Gates was held for four hours and charged with disorderly conduct.[20][21] The charges were dropped five days later, on July 21, 2009, by the Middlesex County district attorney's office, upon the recommendation of the city of Cambridge and the Cambridge Police Department.[22][23] A joint press release by the authorities and Professor Gates said all parties had agreed that this was ""a just resolution to an unfortunate set of circumstances"" and that the incident ""should not be viewed as one that demeans the character and reputation of Professor Gates or the character of the Cambridge Police Department.""[22][23]

Obama replied, ""Now, I've – I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home. And number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact.""[58][59] The President also acknowledged that Gates is a personal friend.[60]

&gt; Jeremy Mill Bernard (born November 4, 1961)[1][2] served as the White House social secretary. Bernard was appointed to the position by President Barack Obama on February 25, 2011. He was the first male, as well as the first openly gay individual, to serve as the White House social secretary.[3][4]

He's seems to have been a bit of a character. Here's a photo of him outside the White House catching snowflakes in his mouth.

For more info, see:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_(cat)

&gt; Larry is a rescued stray cat from the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home who was chosen by Downing Street staff.[5] Larry was intended to be a pet for the children of David and Samantha Cameron, and was described by Downing Street sources as a ""good ratter"" and as having ""a high chase-drive and hunting instinct"".[6] In 2012, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home revealed that Larry's popularity had resulted in a surge of 15% more people adopting cats.

&gt; David Cameron has said that Larry is a ""bit nervous"" around men, speculating that, since Larry was a rescue cat, this may be due to negative experiences in his past. Cameron mentioned that Barack Obama is an apparent exception to this fear: he said, ""Funnily enough he liked Obama. Obama gave him a stroke and he was all right with Obama.""[18]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Mouser_to_the_Cabinet_Office

&gt; The Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office is the title of the official resident cat of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at 10 Downing Street. There has been a resident cat in the English government employed as a mouser and pet since the 1500s, although modern records date only to the 1920s.

Trump's cabinet is almost all White males.

Most of Trump's cabinet meetings are really photo ops, so only the cabinet members he needs to make his point are at the meetings.

Obama's cabinet is there to work and they all have notepads and nanny are taking notes. (Most of the photos of Obama with his staff and cabinet, they're usually carrying notepads and/or briefing folders, including Obama.)

&gt; The Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery covers 982 acres (397 ha) in Elwood, Illinois. It is located approximately 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Chicago, Illinois. When fully completed, it will provide 400,000 burial spaces.

&gt; The cemetery was dedicated in 1999 by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration. It was the 117th national cemetery dedicated under the administration. The cemetery is on the grounds of the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant site, which was formerly known as the Joliet Arsenal.

For more info, see:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Locke

&gt; Gary Faye Locke (born January 21, 1950) is an American politician and diplomat who served as the 10th United States ambassador to China (2011–14). He was previously the 21st governor of Washington (1997–2005) and served in the Obama administration as United States Secretary of Commerce (2009–11). Locke is the first governor in the continental United States of East Asian descent and the only Chinese American ever to have served as a governor of any state. He was also the first Chinese American to serve as the U.S. ambassador to China.

&gt; Locke was chosen to give his party's response to George W. Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address.[11] In a surprise move, Locke announced in July 2003 that he would not seek a third term,[12] saying, ""Despite my deep love of our state, I want to devote more time to my family.""[12] Susan Paynter, a columnist at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, suggested that racist slurs, insults, and threats that Locke and his family received, especially after his rebuttal to Bush's State of the Union address, may have played a role in Locke's decision to leave office after two terms.[13] The governor's office received hundreds of threatening letters and emails; others threatened to kill his children

&gt; Locke was the first Chinese American Secretary of Commerce, and one of three Asian Americans in Obama's cabinet, joining Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. Politico reported Locke was a popular cabinet member among both businesses and the executive branch.

In 1943, the Indiana native enlisted in the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps, and later, she served in the Pacific Theater, earning two bronze stars and rising to the rank of sergeant before being discharged in 1945. After the war, she did civilian work in the army in Japan and Texas for another 26 years. Hari Sreenivasan reports.

Ex presidents always make themselves available to sitting presidents in an advisory role, and I'm sure that will be even more true in this case considering the close relationship Biden and Obama have.

I was very impressed at how good the writing was and how deep and thoughtful Obama himself was. Most ""memoirs"" produced by  politicians are glossy, shallow infomercials in book form even on the rare occasions that they do their own writing (e.g. Bill Clinton does his own writing but its still always sounds like he's giving a speech. You never really feel like you get past the facade). Obama's books are amazingly well-written. He's not just a good writer for a politician, he's a good writer period. He's also extremely honest and thoughtful. He doesn't speak in platitudes. He never vilifies anybody or grinds any ideological axes. It's not a political book. It was written before Obama had ever run for any political office and published in 1995 just before his first Illinois Senate run in 1998. There isn't the slightest indication in the book that he had ever even seriously thought about major political ambitions, much less running for POTUS. It's mostly about his childhood, his family and especially his struggles with trying to find his ""racial"" identity.

I read that book along with his second one in 2008 when he was running for President the first time and I was almost as impressed by the second boo. The second one *is* more political, but still exceptionally well-written, honest and thoughtful.

It isn't just that he is a skillful writer, he shows a lot of deep thought and contemplation about everything he's saying. I can't think of any politicians who have ever been more substantive writers. Certainly not any *modern* politicians.",16,[],[],['Bill Clinton']

Without blame or childish name calling...

* Within hours he declared a major disaster
* He immediately sent FEMA
* Biden provided 60 industrial generators w/diesel fuel for hospitals &amp; power plants
* Over 190,000 gallons of water
* Over 60,000 blankets
* 225,000 meals
* Medical supplies

The relief plans Biden put in motion are still ongoing.

**NOTE:** Days after Biden sent the supplies they were still sitting in the staging area at the airport storage waiting for the republican government to direct how to disperse them.  Days wasted because of republican inept inaction...

On a side note, AOC (a NYC Democrat) raised over 5 million dollars in days (first million in 4 hours) for Texas relief to a large number of charities.  She also flew down to help coordinate plus she volunteered in a soup kitchen.

Beto O'Rourke (a Texas Democrat) organized over 300,000 contacts to seniors and those in need to hook them up with shelter, food, water, rides, therapy and anything else needed to bring back some normalcy in these chaotic times to people who need assistance.

Other Democrats and blue states mobilized to help states battered by the 2nd Texas 100 year storm in 10 years.

Ted Cruz packed his speedo and suntan oil and headed to the Ritz-Carlton in Cancun, Mexico to flee Texas and avoid any responsibility to his state, ignoring his constituents *literally freezing to death*...  

The backlash was so fast &amp; furious that he came back within hours with his tail between his legs.  He then, as a pathetic public relations photo-op stunt, handed out some bottles of water.

*What is irony you ask? 

Ted Cruz realized he had to take his family away from horrible, even deadly conditions at home, so he decided the risk was worth it to cross the Mexican border to safety...  

Look up irony in the dictionary and the pic of Cruz, alone, towing his suitcase behind him in the airport is the perfect definition!  LOL*

Cruz was against sending federal aid for Hurricane Sandy and Katrina and other natural disasters that didn't affect Texas.  Chew on that...

Other Texas Republican politicians, including the Attorney General, also fled the state and ignored their citizens *literally freezing to death*.

The lack of action and accountability of the Texas government is atrocious, both before, during and after (&amp; still).

Biden is a president for all Americans!  

Unlike trump** who ignored &amp; punished blue states &amp; people who didn't vote for or agree with him...  Yet now many red hat republicans are somehow blaming President Biden and AOC for their own self destructive actions leaving their state vulnerable.

You have posted a link to a video website. From the posting rules in the sidebar:

&gt; Only videos of Barack Obama's speeches and interviews *from original sources* (such as C-SPAN or WH.gov) are allowed in r/obama. No rehosted videos. No other videos.

If you want to highlight just a part of a speech or interview, don't post an edited version. Instead, post a link to the whole video with a timestamp to the part you want to highlight.

If your post is not a video of one of Obama's speeches or interviews from an original source, it will be deleted.

Don't get me wrong, I know Trump has always been a bad dude, though I wasn't aware of it until he got into politics. In reality, I doubt this roast changed much if anything. Just felt that way watching things unfold.

Traffic is down over a third from last year. And way down from the sub's high point. There's very rarely at least a dozen users in this sub at one time. 

Surprisingly there are still new subscribers, but net subscriptions is very rarely over 5/day.

The only folks who post to this sub besides me are trolls (who apparently think ""What is Obama's last name?"" is funny and original and are usually associated with a small set of non-sequitur meme subs — I assume it gets discussed in a discord channel).

Posts rarely get 4 comments, with half often troll comments. 

Posts rarely get more than 50 upvotes where even 6-12 months ago over 150 upvotes was fairly common. Which is actually pretty amazing — it means 50-80% of unique visitors have voted on that post.

It might be nice to see some of his old speeches posted, but

From the posting rules in this sub’s sidebar: 

&gt; Only videos of Barack Obama's speeches and interviews from original sources (such as C-SPAN or WH.gov). No rehosted videos. No other videos. No animated GIFs.

Traffic is down over a third from last year. And way down from the sub's high point. There's very rarely at least a dozen users in this sub at one time. 

Surprisingly there are still new subscribers, but net subscriptions is very rarely over 5/day.

The only folks who post to this sub besides me are trolls (who apparently think ""What is Obama's last name?"" is funny and original and are usually associated with a small set of non-sequitur meme subs — I assume it gets discussed in a discord channel).

Posts rarely get 4 comments, with half often troll comments. 

Posts rarely get more than 50 upvotes where even 6-12 months ago over 150 upvotes was fairly common. Which is actually pretty amazing — it means 50-80% of unique visitors have voted on that post.

----

So comment down below. I'm looking for a consensus opinion. Should r/Obama be turned private or just closed to new submissions?

Traffic is down over a third from last year. And way down from the sub's high point. There's very rarely at least a dozen users in this sub at one time. 

Surprisingly there are still new subscribers, but net subscriptions is very rarely over 5/day.

The only folks who post to this sub besides me are trolls (who apparently think ""What is Obama's last name?"" is funny and original and are usually associated with a small set of non-sequitur meme subs — I assume it gets discussed in a discord channel).

Posts rarely get 4 comments, with half often troll comments. 

Posts rarely get more than 50 upvotes where even 6-12 months ago over 150 upvotes was fairly common. Which is actually pretty amazing — it means 50-80% of unique visitors have voted on that post.

----

So comment down below. I'm looking for a consensus opinion. Should r/Obama be turned private or just closed to new submissions?

If you want to help keep the sub going, look for interesting articles to post. You can start here: https://news.google.com/search?for=Obama

Or, for awhile I was posting an official Obama photo a day from Flickr archives. Those usually got a good response.

You have posted a link to a video website. From the posting rules in the sidebar:

&gt; Only videos of Barack Obama's speeches and interviews *from original sources* (such as C-SPAN or WH.gov) are allowed in r/obama. No rehosted videos. No other videos.

If you want to highlight just a part of a speech or interview, don't post an edited version. Instead, post a link to the whole video with a timestamp to the part you want to highlight.

If your post is not a video of one of Obama's speeches or interviews from an original source, it will be deleted.

You have posted a link to a video website. From the posting rules in the sidebar:

&gt; Only videos of Barack Obama's speeches and interviews *from original sources* (such as C-SPAN or WH.gov) are allowed in r/obama. No rehosted videos. No other videos.

If you want to highlight just a part of a speech or interview, don't post an edited version. Instead, post a link to the whole video with a timestamp to the part you want to highlight.

If your post is not a video of one of Obama's speeches or interviews from an original source, it will be deleted.
