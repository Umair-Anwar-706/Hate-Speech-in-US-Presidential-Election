Bush's presidency: the wars and the tax cuts. Including debt service costs, Bush's wars have cost about $1.7 trillion to date. 

Now that's odd.  They left out Bush's medicare prescription drug benefits:   
&gt;The White House released budget figures yesterday indicating that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit **will cost more than $1.2 trillion in the coming decade**, a much higher price tag than President Bush suggested when he narrowly won passage of the law in late 2003.    
[source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9328-2005Feb8.html) (written in 2005)

  That's a huge expense.

Now I wonder why they would leave that out of the article?  Aren't Republicans proud of Medicare Part D?  Shouldn't the people know what other big expenses are adding to the deficit?

wow.   ...  it's not that this fraud had an effect on the primary outcome, it's that if these instances were found then there are likely others and the collection of signatures to get on the ballot is a major hurdle placed on third party and anti-establishment candidates.  They have to collect those signatures and those signatures are scrutinized carefully so that those candidates can be kept off the ballot.  The ballot access hurdle is very costly and prevents them from using those funds for advertising to build their campaign.  ... so if major ""two party"" candidates are able to get away with just forging a bunch of signatures to get on the ballot then it's a very big deal.

&gt;Number two: Indiana’s voter ID law, passed in 2008 and the model for the nine states that have adopted similar laws since the 2010 election, did nothing to prevent the alleged signature fraud, nor did it stop Indiana’s Republican Secretary of State, Charlie White, from committing felony voter fraud in the 2010 election. (White was sentenced to a year of home detention on felony fraud convictions.)

This fraud has absolutely nothing to do with the primary election where the voter ID law would apply.  It was about the collection of signatures to get on the ballot.  There are existing laws against forging signatures for ballot access, and that's why this fraud was discovered.  ",2,[],[],['Barack Obama']

-------
This title is very misleading, as it completely mis-frames the CBO's analysis.  They estimate that a net total of $31 billion dollars more income would go to low-wage workers.  About 16.5 million people would see their wages rise, and somewhere between 0 - 1 million people would lose their jobs.  The *net effect* of this would be about 900,000 fewer people in poverty.

In other words, this is not a contest between 900K people on one hand vs. 500,000 on the other, like the title misleads you into thinking.  It's between *16.5 million* who gain, and somewhere between *none* and *1 million* who lose, with a **net effect** of 900,000 fewer people in poverty.

Presented honestly, it's an obvious win for the country.

Now, I'm very puzzled by the CBO even projecting the possibility of such a large number of job losses.  Sure, they admit a lot of uncertainty on that part (and only that part) of their analysis, indicating that maybe no jobs at all will be lost.  But unless I missed something, they give only one paragraph of this multipage report to the fact that shifting so much income to lower wage workers would greatly increase consumer spending, increasing demand for goods and services, and balancing out the higher cost of hiring.  Also, as far as I can tell, they mostly ignore this for the rest of the analysis.

Based on their figures, it looks like about $20 billion in additional annual spending would be prompted by an increase of the minimum wage to $10.10.  What's the effect of that much high-impact fiscal stimulus on employment?  They never really say.  Why was this left out of the discussion?

Anyway, leave aside that tangent and take their projections at face value.  But look at it honestly, not in the  way the title frames it.  Yes, it's obviously a net win.",3,['Barack Obama'],[],[]

Sure, the CBO is non-partisan.  Regardless, it is very difficult to make such an assured forecast.

Personally, I think this policy will be a wash.  It's political theater.  In a generation this discussion will take place again, the same arguments will be made, and systemic problems with pricing labor will persist; and in twenty years, if esoteric trade agreements like TPP are implemented and $10.10 wage earners compete with $.28 a day workers in say...

 The Myth of the ""liberal"" media

 Let's do a ""what if"" so I can make a point. I think it's a good one. 
 I think it's so good, I'd like to hear from anyone who disagrees.

 What if a show like Dateline did a ""hatchet job"" on George W. Bush? 
 It wouldn't have to really be a hatchet job, but any honest appraisal of that idiot's 
 qualifications would prove he's a non-thinking rich man's boy - and that's all. 
 But what would happen if Dateline did an unflattering portrait of Bush?

 I'll tell you what would happen:

 The vulgar Pigboy would spend at least three hours saying it wasn't true 
 and he'd offer hours of rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Bill O'Reilly would spend at least an hour on his show saying 
 it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Sean Hannity would walk all over Alan Colmes for an hour that night, 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Eva Von Zahn  would spend at least an hour that night saying it wasn't true 
 and she'd offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 The Beltway Boys would spend at least an hour that night saying it 
 wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Brit Hume and Tony Snow would spend at least an hour on Sunday 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Juan Williams and Mara Liason would spend their entire allotted time 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 John McLaughlin would spend at least an hour on his syndicated show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Chris the Screamer would spend at least an hour on his show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 G. Gordon Liddy would spend at least three hours on his radio show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Laura the Whore would spend at least an hour on her radio show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Michael Medved would spend at least an hour on his radio show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Sam and Cokie would spend at least an hour on This Whore 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 George (Judas Maximus) Steffi and George (dumb as a chimp) Will 
 would spend their entire allotted time swearing that it wasn't true.

 Bob Scheiffer would spend at least an hour on Face the Whore 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Tim the Catholic would spend at least an hour on Meet the Whore 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 John Hockenberry would spend at least an hour on his show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Ollie North would spend at least an hour on his radio show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Robert Novak would spend at least an hour on his cable TV show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Paul Weyrich would spend at least an hour on his cable TV show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Still with me? We're close to the end... 

 BSNBC's Brian Williams would spend at least an hour on his show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Wolf the Whore would spend at least an hour on his show saying 
  it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Bill Schneider and Candy Crowley would do an hour special on CCN  
  (Clinton Cock Network) saying it wasn't true, and offering rebuttal. 

 John Stossel would have a special on ABC:  Is lying OK for liberals?

 Then Howie Kurtz would spend 30 minutes on Reliable Sources asking  
  if the media wasn't being too hard on a developmently-disabled child. 

 Barbara Olson would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Ann Coulter would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Laura Ingraham would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Peggy Noonan would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Andrew Sullivan would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  William Safire would write a book condemning Dateline. 

 OK, we're going to call the above ""Exhibit A."" 

 Now, everyone on that list has done at least a dozen hit pieces on Clinton. 

 My question is,   Where is ""Exhibit B?""

 When those 38 people attack Clinton and his cock, who does the rebuttal?

 Even you ditto-sheep have to admit that nobody on that list  
  has EVER defended a fabricated lie against the president. 

 There is no ""Exhibit B,"" because there are so few liberal voices on television.  
  The closest you can get is Eleanor on McLaughlin or Geraldo, but there is barely  
  a liberal whisper on television, even though there are DOZENS of right-wing,  
  Smirk-apologist shows whose livelyhood is lying about liberals. 

 I don't think you ditto-heads can offer an answer.

First of all, the headline writer should be fired. The article isn't about Republican leaders wanting to pick the nominee themselves but how they want to change the Republican primary process where voters pick the nominee. 

But the article itself is bad. It focuses on **how** the GOP wants to change the process with no mention of **why**. *How* they want to change it is to reduce the exposure of Republican candidates to unscripted moments. You know, those moments where they may face tough questions and have to think on their feet. But *why* the GOP wants to reduce those opportunities for voters to get insight into the candidates is the interesting part of the story. The reason is that the Republican Party has become so extreme that it's national candidates have to walk a tightrope. Their message has to be carefully managed so that it doesn't offend either their radical base on one hand or the general public on the other. 

For the 2012 campaign the GOP forgot how wrongheaded much of Republican rhetoric sounds to the rest of the country and just looked at how the extended Democratic primary battle in 2008 helped Barack Obama. That year the Democratic primary contest was long, and actually thoughtful on occasion, and gave plenty of exposure to Obama while John McCain sewed up the nomination quickly and had to wait in the wings with relatively little national attention. With no serious Democratic challenge to be mounted against a sitting president in 2012 the GOP lengthened their primary and scheduled lots of debates figuring they could recreate the same situation in their favor. Oh how they were wrong. 

It's not that there aren't crazy, off the deep end, leftwingers. They certainly exist. But they don't have any political power. The only use the Democratic Party has for them (other than hoping they hate and fear the GOP enough to hold their noses and vote Democratic) is to hold them up to say, ""These are the crazy liberals. We are sensible moderates!"" Democratic rhetoric doesn't alienate general election voters. On the contrary. That's exactly who it is aimed at. So a long and relatively open primary debate was good for eventual Democratic nominee Barack Obama. 

Not so for poor Mitt Romney. To appease the rightwing extremists he was forced to downplay his single significant political success: Romneycare. That made him look like a fool when he had to attack the same basic plan President Obama had gotten enacted on a national level. Romney had to toe the radical conservative line and say he wouldn't make a deal on the budget that included even massive spending cuts if it meant raising taxes slightly. Those sorts of things damaged him in the eyes of general election voters and they also failed to unite the GOP faithful behind him. They continued to see him as a moderate and continued to put up one unviable candidate after another to challenge his frontrunner status. The primary went on and on with one nutjob after another becoming the favorite to unseat Romney as the favorite. It was a joke but Republican leaders weren't laughing.

So they have vowed to make changes this time around. This time they aren't going to forget how toxic many standard Republican views are to mainstream America. They aren't going to let clowns like Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain grab the spotlight and tarnish their nominee. They aren't going to allow debate questions that force candidates to openly take extreme positions to get ahead in the primary but hurt them in the general election. In short, they are going to remember who they are: the batshit crazy party. They will do their best to hide that from general election voters. ",0,[],[],['Barack Obama']

Democrat Quotes on Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction

""One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.""
--President Bill Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998

""If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.""
--President Bill Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998

""Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.""
--Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998

""He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.""
--Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998

""[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.""
Letter to President Clinton, signed by:
-- Democratic Senators Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others, Oct. 9, 1998

""Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.""
-Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998

""Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.""
-- Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999

""There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.""
Letter to President Bush, Signed by:
-- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), and others, Dec 5, 2001

""We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and th! e means of delivering them.""
-- Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002

""We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.""
-- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002

""Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.""
-- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002

""We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.""
-- Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002

""The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons...""
-- Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002

""I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.""
-- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002

""There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.""
-- Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002

""He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do""
-- Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002

""In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.""
-- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002

""We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.""
-- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002

""Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real...""

7160,2015-02-23 14:36:55,The hilarious wingnut scheme to pretend Jeb Bush is a squishy liberal,,2015-02-24 17:17:41,AmericanPolitics,t3_2wvg95,"&gt; I didn't say he is a liberal. Why do people like you insist on putting words in others mouths?

I didn't say you said he is a liberal. Why do people like you insist on pretending to be victims? As usual you could pay more attention so climb on down from that cross. When I say it's wrong to call Jeb Bush a liberal I don't mean, ""You said he was a liberal and you are wrong, wrong, wrong!"" I just mean that he isn't a liberal. I was contrasting what he isn't with what he is: a conservative.

&gt; I said he isn't conservative and he isn't.

This I take issue with. I googled and found  a [Rasmussen poll](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/importance_of_issues) on the top 15 issues facing America. I've listed them in order with Mr Bush's position on each. 

&gt;Economy - Conservative. Supports voodoo economics.
Job creation - Conservative. Tax cuts!!!
Health care - Conservative. Obamacare is the Devil, Bobby Boucher!
Gov. spending - Conservative. Wants to gut social programs.
Education - Mixed. Supports vouchers but also Common Core.
Social Security - Conservative. Wants to ""reform"" it.
Gov. ethics and corruption - Nonpartisan issue. All politicians are ""against"" it.
Taxes - Conservative. Lower for everyone (except poor people). 
Small business - Nonpartisan issue. All politicians are ""for"" them. 
Gun control - Conservative.  He's holding his ground. 
Energy - Conservative. Comes from oil money. 
National Security - Nonpartisan issue. All politicians are ""for"" it. 
Immigration - Not Conservative. Supports comprehensive reform (amnesty)
Environment - Conservative. He's skeptical (of the science but not of the lame arguments against it)
War in Afghanistan - Conservative. ""History will be kind to George W. Bush.""

Jeb Bush is on the right side of 10 of the 12 partisan issues. He has taken a nuanced approach to Education and is on the liberal side of Immigration. 10.5 out of 12 is pretty right wing. I realize those differences loom large from your point of view but try to keep perspective. Jeb Bush is a conservative. ",1,[],[],['George W. Bush']

The NDAA's dangerous detention provisions would authorize the president — and all future presidents — to order the military to pick up and indefinitely imprison people captured anywhere in the world, far from any battlefield. The ACLU will fight worldwide detention authority wherever we can, be it in court, in Congress, or internationally.

 Worse, the NDAA authorizes the military to detain even US citizens under the broad new anti-terrorism provisions provided in the bill, once again without trial.

&gt; During a 2007 Republican presidential debate, candidate Ron Paul said of the Iraq War, &amp;quot;We never should have gone in.""

&gt; Many Republicans continued to mock Paul throughout his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, while the Iraq War and its legacy played no small part in delivering the White House to Barack Obama.

&gt; Jeb Bush disowning the Iraq War represents a significant opportunity within the Republican Party in terms of what kind of foreign policy it might promote moving forward.

My point was that you and Napolitano don't bring the same scrutiny to Republicans who do the same thing or, as in the case of Reagan, send weapons to our enemies. 

The fact is, Republicans have been much more eager to send weapons into war zones over the past 35 years (Iran, Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan, Lebanon, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Somalia, Angola, etc., etc.). These weapons have often wound up in the hands of our enemies. I don't think it's overly partisan to ask why Napolitano only seems to have become concerned about the issue during the Obama administration.

They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.""* - Donald Trump via [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/04/trump-stands-by-views-dangerous-mexican-illegal-immigrants-admits-surprised-by/).  
  
Definition of Racism from Dictionary.com:  
&gt;*noun  
1.  
a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human racial groups determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to dominate others or that a particular racial group is inferior to the others.   
2.   
a policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering such a doctrine; discrimination.   
3.    
hatred or intolerance of another race or other races.*   
   
Trump is heavily implying that all Mexican immigrants are criminals. He also directly states that only ""some"" Mexican immigrants are good people. By disparaging an ethnic group, he is clearly placing himself in the first definition.   
*If you want to get really technical, he has assigned a ""cultural achiecement"" (something a culture does) of ""Bringing drugs, bringing crime...[being] rapists and then some"" to the group in question. Specifying Mexicans implies that this problem only exists in either Mexicans, immigrants, or both. This further implies that his status as a white male is above that of any immigrant, since white males are not ""bringing drugs, bringing crime...[being a rapist] and then some"" like the immigrants apparently are.*  
Secondarily, I do personally feel that it's a pretty clear example of definition 3. Painting any group with such a wide brush makes me think you have problems with that group. But, I suppose that part is an opinion rather than fact.",1,['Donald Trump'],[],['Donald Trump']

&gt;Koch acknowledges government support of renewable energy, but he doesn’t point out the billions of dollars in tax breaks the oil industry receives every year. Koch Industries reaps billions in these century-old tax breaks, and spends millions lobbying specifically to ensure they stay in place. Koch is guilty of what he writes in his op-ed: “Far too many businesses have been all too eager to lobby for maintaining and increasing subsidies and mandates paid by taxpayers and consumers.”

&gt;...

&gt; After launching a campaign on behalf of the Keystone XL pipeline, they stand to benefit from taxpayer subsidies: Price of Oil calculates that refineries for the Keystone XL pipeline would receive over $1 billion in tax breaks for tar sands equipment. The Kochs have avoided talking about on how this would benefit the company. But InsideClimate News recently reported that a Koch subsidiary told regulators it has “direct and substantial interest” in the pipeline. Through its political contributions to Canadian lawmakers, the corporation help itself maintain a stake Canada’s tar sands.

&gt;What if Joe Biden entered the race **with the explicit or strongly implied support of President Obama?**

There's no reason to believe that Obama would support Biden over Clinton, and it's extremely unlikely that he will throw his weight behind any candidate until that person has the nomination locked up. 

Also, I don't think that the black community would immediately rally behind any candidate that Obama endorsed. Biden has never had much support in the black community, and most Americans have only a vague idea of what he stands for.

&gt;Many analysts blame Mitt Romney's 2012 loss on conservatives staying home. 

Many more blame the fact that Romney was promising a return to the same policies that had created the Great Recession.

&gt;Barack Obama got 3.5 million fewer votes in 2012 than in 2008. Usually incumbents who drop that far lose. But Romney got only 1 million more votes than John McCain in 2008.

So... the conservative got more votes in 2012 than in 2008 and this shows that conservatives stayed home? Sounds more like it was the liberals who stayed home.

&gt;The big question now is whether another candidate can entice Trump's predominantly older, non-college-graduate enthusiasts. Hmm.

No, the big question is how the Republicans plan to win by appealing only to white men. Reagan won in a landslide in 1980. Romney got a bigger percentage of the white vote than Reagan, and lost the election. Now Republicans are going to win because Trump brought even more white people in to vote Republican, while driving even more nonwhite voters away?

&gt; If you look at the double-dip recession that lasted from January 1980 to November 1982, government employment did go down during the recession. (Officially, these were two recessions during that stretch. However, they were so closely spaced, and with such a short ""recovery"" in between, that the statistics are a lot less messy if you consider them to be one long recession.)

When you are making a point you want to use clear examples. By giving us stats from 2 separate downturns they are in effect admitting that President Obama is right. It hasn't happened in a single recession or they would have given a better example. 

So we have a situation where a lot of government workers lost their jobs between these recessions. Why might that happen? It might be that they were temporary workers.

I would definitely disagree with that. The problem is that given the US' post-9/11 *bi-partisan* wars to expand our empire and to establish US hegemony over the Middle East and other areas of the world, there is a distinct gray area of what is ""US politics"" and what is ""foreign politics.""

For example, the current US/Saudi war on Yemen is a classic example.

We know for a fact that Obama *personally* called the Yemeni dictator and requested a Yemeni reporter be imprisoned for telling the truth and revealing the US lies that we were not bombing in Yemen. The reporter was then imprisoned by Yemen.

Today our Saudi puppet is waging war on Yemen to put the Yemeni dictator back into power.

Oh before I forget...I said nothing about cap and trade but if really want to know here ya go.

&gt;On that basis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the net
annual economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be
$22 billion—or about $175 per household. That figure includes the cost of
restructuring the production and use of energy and of payments made to foreign
entities under the program, but it does not in
clude the economic benefits and other
benefits of the reduction in GHG emissions and the associated slowing of climate
change. CBO could not determine the inci
dence of certain pieces (including both
costs and benefits) that represent, o
n net, about 8 percent of the total. For the
remaining portion of the net cost, househol
ds in the lowest income quintile would
see an average
net benefit
of about $40 in 2020, while households in the highest
income quintile would see a
net cost
of $245. Added costs for households in the
second lowest quintile would be about $40 that year; in the middle quintile, about
$235; and in the fourth quintile, about $340. **Overall net costs would average 0.2
percent of households’ after-tax income.**

Whoever wins the Democratic primary (and the word out of Washington is that the Vice President will announce today) will be solid candidate who can appeal to various kinds of people because that's what it takes to win the primary. And they will likely win. 

The GOP is at a slight disadvantage in presidential races but absolutely could win with a good candidate The Republican primary seems seems likely to again produce the opposite of that. Their party is so far to the right of the rest of the country that the ideal Republican presidential candidate is now the same as their ideal Supreme Court candidate: one who says as little as possible so there is less chance that people will find out how radical they really are. Quiet candidates don't win primaries. 

So the Democratic nominee seems likely to become the next president. So what? I mean, it's great that it's not any of the Republican contenders in the White House but what is this next Democratic presidency going to look like? Remember, President Obama's administration will only be considered a success because they were able to get things done when they controlled both houses of Congress after the wave election of 2008. If next year isn't a wave election the GOP will remain in control of at least the House so no Democratic legislation will be passed. Can Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden produce a wave election? I don't think so. 

But remember those Republicans who like Bernie Sanders? Yes, extra votes in Vermont are not exactly the most valuable political capital for Bernie but if he can appeal to them then why not to Republican leaning voters elsewhere? Of all of the Democratic candidates I think only Bernie Sanders has a real chance to create a wave election. A wave that sweeps in him and plenty of Democrats on his coattails. A wave that gives Democrats another rare chance to show how they can govern without Republican obstructionism. 

So to me the choice is not between a candidate who might win and one who might not. To me it is about a candidate who might be able to actually do some good and perhaps even transform our politics and a candidate who, at best, is keeping the White House out of enemy hands while the GOP, safe in their fortress in the House, bides their time until they can reclaim the presidency.

On social issues he's not. During the debate he took some flak for being less progressive on gun control. It's the economy. Sanders is good on bread and butter issues. Jobs, affordable college and health care. Economic security is important to everyone outside of the upper classes. Even social conservatives. Every other candidate is beholden to the 1% who fund their elections and who will be paying them for past favors once they retire from public life. That is who Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and all the rest work for. Bernie works for us. 

Obviously that's an exaggeration but that's his appeal. That's what makes him different. I'm not saying he *would* form a wave election. But he's the only one with a chance to do so. And the country and the world needs another Democratic wave to move us forward. So long as the Republicans hold the House they can put off the ""inevitable"" day of reckoning when radicalizing white people is no longer a viable strategy. I also worry about complacency and can't help but notice that the DNC isn't putting the resources into organizing state races. Bernie is the only chance for that in next year's election.

As for the rest of your comment: you may be under the mistaken notion that Al Qa3da could have been throttled in the cradle. If that were the case then you should familiarize yourself with the political manifesto issued by Al Qa3da back in the 90's after the U.S. landed troops in Saudi Arabia during Desert Shield and later Desert Storm. If we're playing the blame game, let's go back to former President George HW Bush. 

Better yet, let's go back to former President Reagan and U.S. support for Afghan mujahideen. Anti- communist fervor led to the training and facilitation of future Al Qa3da operatives. This was where Bin Laden would receive his own training and begin to collect the group that became infamous in 2001.

We could also discuss U.S. interference with and denial of self determination in any number of countries domestic affairs since 1945. U.S. foreign policy has been a disaster because of the Cold War.

These are all indirect consequences though. Personally, I think that creating a space for Al Qa3da to fill in the vacuum left by the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 is DIRECTLY responsible for the establishment of Islamic State, Al Nusra, and the myriad of other mutations of Al Qa3da's ideology.

As for Kasich, the 538 article may be abstract but it actually deals with what you are talking about, the homestate effect of the VP nominee, whereas the numbers you give do not. Your numbers are his support for *president*. Yes, he is popular in Ohio. Presumably these historic VP nominees were also popular or else they wouldn't have become the VP nominee. The upshot is that with that running mate popularity the GOP should only expect a bump of 2%-4% in Ohio. That's significant, of course.

So the title of the article is technically correct. *Some* scholars did rank Obama at the bottom. But most did not and so he ends up in the middle. 

If we look closer at it, President Obama is taking flak for being ""divisive"". That almost certainly reflects the political views of the scholars and we should expect it to fade with time. After all, the last bitterly divisive Democratic president Bill Clinton is now near the top of the list at #8. As time goes by and political feeling subsides the voting will become less extreme.

“Democrats would probably like to attribute a large portion of the D-R growth gap to better fiscal (and perhaps monetary) policies, but the data do not support such a claim,” the authors concluded. “If anything, and we would not make much of such small differences, both fiscal and monetary policy actions seem to be a bit more pro-growth when a Republican is president — even though GDP grows significantly faster under Federal Reserve chairmen appointed by Democrats than by Republicans.”

Rather, the authors said there were factors independent of presidential fiscal policy driving the gap.

Shocks in oil prices, changes in productivity levels, growth in defense spending (wartime defense spending is generally good for the economy), foreign economic growth and differences in consumer expectations account for “as much as 70% of the partisan gap,” the authors wrote. “Some, maybe all, of these might be considered blends of good policy and good luck. But our empirical analysis does not attribute any of the partisan growth gap to fiscal or monetary policy.”

As for the other unexplained 30 percent? “The rest remains, for now, a mystery of the still mostly-unexplored continent,” the authors state.

The authors both told us Clinton was “100 percent accurate” with her claim that the economy does better under Democratic presidents, based on their research (which Blinder said has been thoroughly peer-reviewed and is set to be published in the American Economic Review). Blinder served on President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, and he was an economic adviser to the presidential campaigns of Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry.

The authors in their 2014 paper talked about factors that might be attributed to “just good luck,” while the 2015 report refers to “blends of good policy and good luck.” Blinder told us via email that they avoided the term “just good luck” in the 2015 paper for two reasons.

“One reason for superior performance under Democratic presidents is that oil prices go up less (on average),” Blinder stated. “Is that just luck? Well, the fact that we entered several wars in the gulf area (the latest in 2003) under Republican presidents, thereby driving up oil prices, was not just luck — it was policy, though not economic policy.”

“The second main factor underpinning Democratic superiority is that productivity has risen faster under Democrats,” Blinder said. “Well, productivity growth depends on many things, including luck, but also including a myriad of policies.”

In other words, there may very well be policies from Democratic presidents that have led to better economic performance. But the authors were unable to pinpoint what those policies were.

We have no doubt economists from either side of the partisan divide would have differences of opinion about what those policies might be, or whether the gap was entirely due to factors outside a president’s control. That’s a political debate that cannot be settled in a fact-check. Specifically, though, while Clinton recites the economic statistics as a reason for electing a Democratic president, there is no evidence in the Blinder and Watson research to conclude that a Democratic president’s economic policy would necessarily lead to a healthier economy.

&gt; Fifty percent of voters nationwide, including three in four Democratic voters, view the former president favorably, higher than his spouse and her chief rival, Bernie Sanders.

&gt; Less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses, there is growing anxiety bordering on panic among Republican elites about the dominance and durability of Donald Trump and Ben Carson and widespread bewilderment over how to defeat them.

&gt; At a campaign event in Springfield, Ill., Donald Trump attacked rival Ben Carson over claims about Carson&amp;#039;s violent youth and suggested a boycott of coffee giant Starbucks over the design of its Christmas coffee cups.

&gt; One well-funded outside group, the Club for Growth, has aired ads attacking Trump in Iowa and more recently came out against Carson as well.

3. Why is Obama administration still admitting the refugees while the FBI had repeatedly and openly confessed of its inability to fully screen/vet these refugees?
4. Why is the Obama administration ignoring the potential terrorist threats, especially even after ISIS announced its threat and intention to infiltrate America (and Europe) using the refugees as the Trojan horses?
5. Why is the Obama administration admitting only non-persecuted Muslims and not the persecuted Christians or other non-Muslims (Yazidis, Zoroastrians, etc.)?
6. Why is the Obama administration admitting these so-called 'refugees' at all knowing that most of them are not true refugees and coming from countries currently without any military, political, nor religious conflicts whatsoever (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Morocco, Algeria, etc.)

Islam is like rabies, and Muslims are its patients, and bad ones as that. Once the animals contracted the disease which degenerates the central nervous system, behavior, thinking, and most have to be put down, unfortunately, since there is no cure. 

It is true that the problem are both with Islam AND Muslims. An ideology that advocates killing, murdering, stoning, beheading, burning, enslaving women, raping, sexual-grooming, pedophilia, etc. is a dark, nefarious, toxic cult, and not really something that can be considered a world religion, and the fact that there are people who still decide to follow such meme of death and destruction while there are plenty of other better choices is problematic by and in itself. A toxin only causes problems if there are people who drink it. Most Muslims drink it WILLINGLY!

Think about the carnage the Muzzies have been inflicting on non-Muslims (Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus) and even on Muzzies themselves, across the Muslim world, for centuries (http://freedompost.org/media/islam-killed-most-people.jpg), and recently in the non-Muslim world and in the West. 

Muslims currently compose only %1.6 of U.S. population but cause %30-40 of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. %49.9 Muslims support Bin Laden. %38 supports 9/11 attack that killed nearly 3,000 American civilians. %49.9 and %38 of something is never a tiny minority like the Muslim want to taqiyya, or deceive, the ""kafirs"", or ""unbelievers"", to believe. Indeed, %99 of nearly 27,000 terrorist attacks worldwide since 9/11 have been caused by Muslims, unfortunately.

&gt; After two Bostonians allegedly beat up a homeless Hispanic man in August, one told police he was inspired by Donald Trump&amp;#039;s message that &amp;quot;All these illegals need to be deported.&amp;quot; In response, Trump explained &amp;quot;That people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.&amp;quot; Later, he clarified that in no way, of course, does he does condone violence.

&gt; The Trump candidacy has combined fears over terrorism, crime and a coming white minority into a spectacular fever dream of dangerous refugees and a criminal threat posed by black people and Hispanic immigrants.

&gt; On Sunday, Donald Trump tweeted an incendiary and totally false graphic positing that the vast majority of both whites and blacks are killed by black people.

&gt; Donald Trump told a really &amp;quot;HUGE&amp;quot; - as he would put it - lie when he claimed to have watched thousands of Muslims cheering in Jersey City, New Jersey, as the World Trade Center came down on 9/11. Every corporate news outlet in the country rushed to debunk Trump&amp;#039;s fictitious account.

&gt; Most U.S. intelligence sources believed the men were Israeli spies, and that their &amp;quot;Moving company&amp;quot; was an Israeli intelligence cover.

&gt; Later that day, I learned from local and national news outlets about the five Israelis who were dancing with delight about a mile upriver from me and the two other Israelis.

&gt; To those who were interested in Ron Paul because he poked the establishment in the eye, it&amp;#039;s plausible, as Massie said, that Trump is an equally appealing &amp;quot;Middle finger to Washington.&amp;quot; To those who were interested in Ron Paul because he espouses small government positions however, the thought of Trump as president is nothing short of terrifying.

Nothing? Of course not. Of course they have *some* role. In general, they're the people the rich and their mass media are targeting and manipulating.

And when the DNC, the rich and their media corporations successfully rig the outcome, those same primary voters will be expected to vote for a war-loving war criminal who finds joy in death -- they'll be manipulated into believing that a vote for Hillary is a vote not for a ""lesser evil"" and to ignore that they're voting for evil.

&gt; If that's true, why are we talking about matchups with Donald Trump?

Trump is not the Republicans' candidate. There's still a lot of time for the Republicans to nominate someone else. In the past couple/few weeks we've seen the media start to trash Trump, but it's a double-edged sword for the media -- they love the ""show"" and ratings that Trump gives them, even though he's not what they want. But Trump is rich, is fairly safe, so he may well indeed be the nominee (the Republicans will likely lose the election anyway, so it's not a critical matter).

Being a son of an immigrant and a nephew of a freedom fighter from a place of oppression (Communist Cuba ruled by Fidel Castro at the time), Ted Cruz knew too well the value of individual freedoms and what it was like not to have them. Ted Cruz loves America and its values, and America is fortunate to have someone like Ted (and Donald Trump) to take back the country from the heavily infiltrated enemy that deviously and surreptitiously planed to overthrow this Constitutional Republic and replace the U.S. Constitution with Sharia Law. It was unfortunately that most Americans were, and still are, too ignorant to truly understand the Islamic death rape cult as, for the most part, a repressive, subversive, supremacist theocratic political system masquerading as a religion that also teaches people to lie (Taqiyya/Kitman), so that the Muslim-In-Chief (http://freedompost.org/muslim/infiltration/barack-hussein-obama-the-muslim-in-chief.html) was able to taqiyya his way to the White House with ease to contribute his part to the global Islamic jihad effort (http://freedompost.org/islam/deception/civilization-jihad-aka-stealth-jihad.html), and the consequence was rather harrowing, devastating, and deadly, not only for the U.S. and its citizens but also for the non-Muslim world, especially for Christians, Yazidis, and non-Muslims in the Middle East and Europe.

While most Americans were being fed with their usual daily doses of the brain-numbing ""Kardashians"", ""Dancing with the Stars"", and ""Honey Boo Boo"",  Ted Cruz was working hard at the U.S. Supreme Court, and subsequently at the U.S. Senate, to defend the U.S. Constitution, individual liberties, religious freedom, and American values.

It's great timing that Ted Cruz is now available for the rescue of the nation in crisis from the spiraled lawlessness and corruptions now ubiquitous in Washington D.C., to preserve and protect the land, the U.S. Constitution, and the fruit of labor of the American Founding Fathers and their collective geniuses, from being sabotaged by the enemies, both foreign and domestic.

Great speech by the Great Communicator! The most beloved U.S. President in American history left his legacy for the next intrepid one to defend freedom, against the enemies, bot foreign and domestic, which have since his leave, have not only infiltrated Washington D.C. but also infested states, cities, and towns across the nation. America is in crisis mode once again.

Fortunately, both current leading GOP U.S. Presidential candidates, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, come to the rescue. Both, with embodied spirit of Ronald Reagan as true conservatives with principles, represent America's best hopes to clean out the heavily infiltrated and infested D.C. swamp, exterminate the cockroaches, restore much needed leadership, strengthen national security, protect American citizens, and defend the U.S. Constitution.

You can say that if you like, but the fact is that ISIS could not have taken vast swaths of territory if Iraq had been a strong democracy.

Bush left the Sunni areas of the country in the hands of warlords who were being paid to support the government. Not surprisingly, these warlords were either overwhelmed or joined ISIS as soon as it became clear that the Iraqi troops that Bush spend 5 years training were running from the battlefield.

&gt;Tom Cotton needlessly blocks key counter-terrorism nominee


A Republican senator on Wednesday blocked an effort to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee for a key Treasury post responsible for leading the battle against terrorism and financial crimes.
     
The president nominated Adam Szubin a year ago, but his nomination has languished, caught up in Senate politics. Szubin, who has served under both Obama and predecessor George W. Bush, has worked in the anti-terror job in an acting capacity.
     
Democrats tried to secure a vote on Wednesday, but Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., objected, citing the possibility that the Obama administration would ease financial restrictions that prohibit U.S. dollars from being used in transactions with Iran.

&gt;Evidently, the right-wing Arkansan believes the White House may, at some point in the future, ease those restrictions, so Cotton decided to block a nominee who works on preventing terrorist financing, as if this somehow made sense.

&gt;When asked whether it was wrong for the United States to intervene in WWI? In WWII? Johnson's entire answer was ""I don't know.""

...

&gt;Johnson was the only candidate who said he would require drivers to have licenses

...

&gt; ""I'm not smart enough to say whether global warming is man-made,” said Johnson.

...

&gt;Libertarian candidate Austin Petersen, seen widely as Johnson's stiffest competition, said we don't need the government to build roads because ""in the future, we’ll have jetpacks.""

...

&gt;On global warming: ""Whether or not global warming is real not, it’s not the government’s business to fight it,” said Petersen. Only John McAfee acknowledged man-made climate change.

...

&gt;When asked how they would fund things like healthcare and the military, some of the candidates insisted they would depend on citizens' ""voluntary contributions."" ""The military should be as big as can be on donations and bake sales,"" said Darryl Perry.

&gt; building advanced narratives about a group's behavior, motives, and morals based on cherry-picked instances

Same answer above

&gt; if that's the case, you'd have to back off on all your Muslim hate, too

Of course that is not the case, but even if it is, Google 'the most hated cult on the planet' and see 'Islam' as the unanimous answer for yourself. Surprised? Many are NOT. Muzzies knowingly earn this hate upon yourselves by causing sufferings all over the world, even within their families and communities with honor-killings (http://freedompost.org/islam/honor-killings.html, http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/08/middleeast/mother-sets-pakistani-woman-on-fire-police-say/ , etc.) More and more people recognize that you Muzzies are a few notches below animals in terms of moral and intellectual development because even animals do NOT usually kill their offspring.

You keep mentioning these things but not actually demonstrating their use, other than the persistent (across multiple posts) mention of this:

&gt;Google 'the most hated cult on the planet' and see 'Islam' as the unanimous answer for yourself.

Which does not seem like particularly useful data for a few reasons.

First, if it's the only data point you have (and that seems to be the case since it's the only one you ever reference), then that seems like it makes for a weak argument. Wouldn't you want as much proof as possible? Again, I'm just trying to understand your reasoning because, as you have so helpfully pointed out many times previously, I'm kind of an idiot, and I'm having trouble following what you're saying.

Second, are you arguing that if enough people hate something that it certainly deserves to be hated? Is it not possible for people to have been misled or to have formed their opinions based on erroneous information? Why should anyone take someone else's opinion as a reason to take so strong a stance as the one you're advocating?

Third, what is the metric for determining the ""most hated cult on the planet""? Were Muslims themselves accounted for? I think there are like a billion of them, and I doubt they would answer that way. Is it possible that this is merely the opinion of a particularly vocal few that has been blown out of proportion? Again, without knowing methodology, it seems difficult to know for certain how seriously to take this information.

But back to this: 

&gt;Again, statistics matter. Sample, population, statistical significance, etc. If you have no idea what I am discussing, you might want to study basic math &amp; statistics

It seems that providing this information would help to convince others of your opinions. Rather than simply insisting that it exists, wouldn't it demonstrate the superiority of your position if you could provide a mountain of objective evidence supporting it? Because without that information it gives the impression that you're simply filtering a wide array of articles, videos, and reports with the purpose of leaving out the stuff that contradicts your opinion and only letting through the stuff that seems to support it. 

Of course, for that to work, you would have to examine the other side of the argument and ascertain first whether or not it had any validity, and then find evidence discrediting it. Since I'm so stupid, I hope you'll be able to find out for certain and share with everyone soon!

&gt;Muzzies knowingly earn this hate upon yourselves

&gt;you Muzzies

Again, why do you think I'm Muslim? As much as I want to understand your opinions and ways of thinking, I find it undermines your position as an authority when you cling to erroneous assumptions like this based on no evidence whatsoever.

Until Mr. Trump releases his taxes, is net worth is merely speculation.  Both Forbes and Fortune estimate his total worth to be around $4bil, most of which is based in the various pieces of property he owns.  His actually liquid assets is most likely much, much lower.

But I digress, you made the argument that America needs a ""businessman like Trump"" because it has been ""spending far more money than it has for decades"".  Trump has taken his businesses through bankruptcy 4 times.  Do you understand bankruptcy and why a business enters into it?  A business enters bankruptcy because it borrows more money that it makes and it gets to a point where it can no longer pay its bills.

I am not gonna argument that Trump has been successful at certain times of his career and that he does have a net worth much greater than 99.9999% of us, but this notion that because he runs a business that he will fix a debt issue is absurd and ill-informed.",1,['Donald Trump'],[],[]

History says Hillary Clinton wins.,,2016-07-02 08:01:39,AmericanPolitics,t3_4qh6ju,"&gt; Three big election moments remain: the selection of the vice presidential nominees, the party conventions and the fall debates. Breathless coverage notwithstanding, none of these has had a measurable impact in changing the outcome of a presidential election in at least 40 years.

I wonder how they are determining this. I remember back in 2000 when George W Bush got a debate bump after the ""Bush Lied, Gore Sighed"" fiasco so I went hunting for some numbers and found this Gallup webpage:

http://www.gallup.com/poll/2338/major-turning-points-2000-election-primary-season-party-conventio.aspx

&gt; A review of CNN/USA Today/Gallup polling conducted throughout this election year suggests three major turning points in the election -- the primary season, when George W. Bush's double-digit lead over Al Gore, persisting for over a year, was cut in half; the party conventions, when Al Gore emerged as highly competitive with Bush; and the presidential debates, when the Texas governor moved back into the lead -- even if only by a few percentage points. 

That certainly suggests to me that the Washington Post story is incorrect but maybe they are using a different methodology. ",1,[],[],['George W. Bush']

The only exception is something that could happen in the next election (2020). If a party get 5% of the popular vote their candidate is eligible for federal matching funds for the next election.

&gt;
&gt;**The amounts involved, the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a Special Prosecutor. After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton’s crimes.**
&gt;
&gt;Some former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the corrupt Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of a RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization) enterprise.
&gt;
&gt;The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent Special Prosecutor because it has proven itself to be a political arm of the White House.
&gt;
&gt;The DOJ has acted very unethically, particularly the Attorney General's private lengthy meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before the Department's decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against almost any other citizen.

&gt; President Barack Obama used a pseudonym in email communications with Hillary Clinton and others, according to FBI records made public Friday.

&gt; Additional FBI interviewees whose reports were made public Friday included Jake Sullivan, Clinton&amp;#039;s policy planning director; Bryan Pagliano, a former Clinton technology aide; Monica Hanley, a veteran Clinton aide who worked for her in the Senate and at State; and Sidney Blumenthal, Clinton&amp;#039;s longtime confidant.

&gt; Hanley revealed in her FBI interview that she had no idea where a thumb drive she used to store an archive of Clinton&amp;#039;s emails had gone.

But the bottom line here is that I think that what Secretary Clinton and I have done since the election, since the primary nominating process we have worked together in a number of areas. Secretary Clinton has worked with me to make certain that public colleges and universities become tuition free for all families earning $125,000 or less. That we double funding for community health centers, which means that we'll have access to primary care for millions more Americans and, by the way, apropos to Donald Trump not paying any taxes, she's come up with an estate tax proposal which will ask the very wealthiest people in this country, wealthiest families in this country to start paying their fair share.

&gt; A Newsweek investigation has found that in at least two of Trump&amp;#039;s last three construction projects, Trump opted to purchase his steel and aluminum from Chinese manufacturers rather than United States corporations based in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.

&gt; Another recent Trump building that has used metal from China is Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, which opened in 2009.

&gt; During the time of the Trump Chicago construction, according to documents filed with the United States Court of International Trade by the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce, Permasteelisa was dumping aluminum used in curtain walls, meaning it was using predatory pricing to sell the products below the cost of production or the amount charged in China.

3rd, I just don't believe Clinton will keep her word. She is bought and sold to the corporations and is currently pandering to right wing lobbyists. To quote Sanders “And if Secretary Clinton wins, it is incumbent upon her to tell millions of people who right now do not believe in establishment politics or establishment economics, who have serious misgivings about a candidate who has received millions of dollars from Wall Street and other special interests.”

“She has to go out to you.”

4th, George W. Bush actually got more DEMOCRATS to vote for him then Nader. Also we live in a democracy, If I believe Nader is the better candidate, I will vote for him.

&gt; The first sign of trouble came the day before the evening groping, in an initial business meeting in which, Harth and Houraney say, Trump spent the time asking about the breasts of the beauty contestants - real or enhanced? - and staring at Harth, then 30.

&gt; In fairness to Trump, other senior men in politics and business - John Kennedy and Bill Clinton come to mind - also sometimes showed a sense of entitlement toward young women.

&gt; A version of this op-ed appears in print on October 9, 2016, on page SR11 of the New York edition with the headline: Donald Trump, Groper in Chief.

the article states: *We’ve all heard of Trump’s unethical or loutish behavior, most recently in a 2005 recording unearthed by The Washington Post on Friday in which he boasts of kissing and groping women.*

the article cited: http://archive.is/F8QtY

it looks like the cited article *was* published on the 7th, and updated or edited on the 8th. however, this story being published within hours of another article, with a direct reference to that article from that same day is a difficult pill to swallow.

the wikipedia entry for the washington post states: *According to a 2009 publication, in the blogging community, liberal bloggers link to The Washington Post and The New York Times more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.*

i wouldn't be surprised to discover that these articles were bought and paid for by some democrat party front, and strategically released within hours of each other to reinforce the public perception of trump being a sexist. i also wouldn't be surprised if the articles were neither bought nor paid for, but charitably offered by both news organizations, which have a blatant history of anti-trump content, much of it being sensationalist and manipulative pap.

i'm guessing that this is a coordinated effort by multiple democrat-affiliated and sympathizing parties, and yesterday and today aren't the end of it. to what end, i don't know, but perhaps to prep the public to perceive donald trump's expressions in a very specific and critical light during the sunday debate. i assume that hillary clinton has been preparing to focus on the sexism angle for this upcoming debate. these articles, and whatever else may pop up, are an attempt to prime the chamber so that when she pulls the trigger something...explosive may happen?

it will be interesting to see whether the trump campaign can work against that momentum. the republican party already has its standard spineless cowards, such as paul ryan, curling into the fetal position and begging not to be included in the criticism.",0,['Donald Trump'],[],['donald trump']

&gt; At the presidential debate on Sunday night, co-moderator Anderson Cooper spent a lot of time trying to get Donald Trump to answer a simple question: Had he ever-as he boasted in the instantly infamous video with Billy Bush-grabbed a woman &amp;quot;By the pussy&amp;quot; or kissed her unexpectedly? After a lot of dithering, Trump said, &amp;quot;And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not.&amp;quot; He then tried to take the conversation right back to his comfort zone: borders.

&gt; In yet another report from today, CBS News produced a 1992 video from Entertainment Tonight shot at Trump Tower: &amp;quot;In the clip, Trump asks one of the 10-year-old girls if she&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;going up the escalator.&amp;#039; When the girl replies, &amp;#039;yeah,&amp;#039; Trump turns to the camera and says: &amp;#039;I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?&amp;#039;&amp;quot;.

&gt; Still others are making full-fledged allegations of sexual assault against Trump.

&gt;These aren’t just Democratic National Committee regulars,” he said in an interview with The Real News Network. “What you’re seeing is complete domination by what used to be the Democratic Leadership Council. So this was a group we talked about in the past. Very, very, very right-wing on foreign policy, what they called a muscular foreign policy, which was a euphemism for invading places. And very, very tough on crime — this was that era of mass incarceration that Bill Clinton pushed...

&gt;And on the economic side, they were all in favor of austerity. All in favor of privatization. Tried to do a deal with Newt Gingrich to privatize Social Security. And of course, were all in favor of things like NAFTA.

&gt;As for Hillary Clinton’s widely heralded “move to the left” in recent months, Black said that it “was purely calculated for political purposes. And all of the team that’s going to hire all the key people and vet the key people for the most senior positions for at least the first several years of what increasingly looks likely to be a Clinton administration are going to be picked by these people, who are the opposite of progressive.”

&gt; Several Clinton aides discuss what political opinion their candidate should take on the controversial energy pipeline known as Keystone XL. In May 2015 Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook pointed to a report that the Clinton Foundation had received money from one of the project&amp;#039;s backers, emailing that &amp;quot;The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone?&amp;quot;.

&gt; Doug Band, a long-time personal aide to Bill Clinton, complained that Chelsea Clinton was meddling in his consulting firm, where the former president served as a paid adviser, and also interfering with his work at the Clinton Foundation.

&gt; Chelsea Clinton, 36, had recently taken a role at the Clinton Foundation, and had complained in emails that Mr Band&amp;#039;s consultancy was contacting members of the British Parliament &amp;quot;On behalf of President Clinton&amp;quot;.

""Could""? Sure, it *could.*

But considering the ""friends"" that any US president makes and the ""favors"" that rich people owe him, as we've seen from other presidents, Trump knows that he can cash in **BIG TIME** doing deals anywhere in the world as president and and as a former president once he's out of office.

Like Bill Clinton and others have proved, being an ex-president pays very, very well.

&gt; Or with his repeated and fawning public admiration of Putin?

You sound like the TV or NYT! Please give a couple of examples of this fawning -- because from what I've seen, this is hyperbole to the point of being raw propaganda.

&gt; Or with the Russian government's demonstrated use of Wikileaks to attack the U.S. electoral system?

Now *this* I'm interested in! Please give some actual evidence and proof of this.

Because from what I've read, these are simply *allegations* from the Democratic Party and our lying government with absolutely no proof to back up the claims.

Now, let's examine things from a different angle.

Could it be that Trump sees several things:

* that the US wasted *trillions* on wars of aggression to take over the Middle East
* that we lost in Iraq, we're losing in Afghanistan, and all politicians know that the American people wouldn't stand for another big war
* and anyone with eyes sees that our project to overthrow the Syrian government by using Muslim fundamentalist proxy soldiers (because we're too cowardly to do our own fighting) is going down the tubes

Could it be that Trump is actually being smart and using a strategy to use the Russians as our proxies and to let them clean up the mess that we created in Syria?

&gt; Or with the certainly that Putin would much rather deal with Trump during the next 4-8 years than with Hillary Clinton?

Hillary Clinton has called Putin ""Hitler"" and has said that Putin has ""no soul."" Given that, If you were Putin wouldn't you prefer to avoid dealing with Hillary Clinton?

&gt; Despite repeatedly bragging about all the good work the Clinton Foundation did to help Haiti recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake, at least one Haitian, former Senate President Bernard Sansaricq, thinks it was the Clintons, not the Hiatian people, who benefitted most from the Foundation&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Charitable work&amp;quot; in Haiti.

&gt; Sandy Rios of American Family Radio interviewed former Haitian Senate President Bernard Sansaricq on Thursday, and the enraged Haitian had nothing good to say about the Clintons.

&gt; Sansaricq said although Bill Clinton was put in charge of the reconstruction, he did absolutely nothing but give contracts to his cronies and built a sweatshop next to a goldmine that was given to Hillary Clinton&amp;#039;s brother, Anthony Rodham, in violation of the Haitian constitution.

&gt; Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday&amp;#039;s FBI announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state?

&gt; Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea.

&gt; For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence.

&gt; Yes, we&amp;#039;re talking about the possible existence of a Trump sex tape.

&gt; Well, hold on, Trump did falsely accuse Alicia Machado of making a sex tape, which in Trump Psych 101 means Trump has a sex tape.

&gt; The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary&amp;#039;s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs.

&gt; In the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office.

&gt; On April 13, 2009, Clinton attorney Cheryl Mills informed newly sworn-in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton via email that the National Archives could not account for a two-terabyte hard drive.

&gt; &amp;quot;Two terabytes is a very very large amount of data; the drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House,&amp;quot; wrote Blake Roberts, deputy associate White House counsel for President Barack Obama.

&gt; In the last week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to zero out all federal spending on clean energy research and development.

&gt; If Trump isn&amp;#039;t planning to zero out federal funding for clean technology development and deployment, then there is no possible way of coming anywhere close to $100 billion dollars over eight years or $12.5 billion a year.

&gt; You may consider it unlikely Trump would follow through, but I was at the U.S. Department of Energy working on clean energy when the GOP took back the House in 1995, led by Newt Gingrich.

Wow, I can't tell if that's sarcasm or not. :(

&gt; Unemployment is way down in the past four years.

Cooking the unemployment stats by defining millions of working people as ""discouraged workers"" and thus removing them from the statistics so the administration can report absurdly low unemployment rates might work with the corporate mass media, but huge numbers of Americans know reality and refuse to buy the government's lies and cooked stats.

&gt; They just THINK they're oppressed because of the rise of social progressivism,

I'd say that there are drops of truth in that, but the *far larger* reason they think they're oppressed is because they see their standard of living falling like a rock, their communities are mere shells full of boarded up stores/buildings and they're seeking scapegoats to blame.

Did you actually watch that Michael Moore clip in the link above? Moore's saying the same thing I and many others are. This is not a wild-assed view of things.

&gt; They feel threatened and Trump promised them the Good Olde Days, when blacks and non-Christians and gays and women knew their place.

Yes, there's no doubt Trump's rhetoric appeals to a fairly mythical, nostalgic view of US history, and there's no doubt Trump is not a feminist and has a strong racist background. But that still doesn't negate the truth or role of Bill Clinton's slogan: It's the economy stupid.

&gt; it's apparent now that Clinton actually won the popular vote, so this is another one like 2000. 

I'd say it's *not* like 2000! Yes, the undemocratic Electoral College needs to be abolished, that's been clear for decades. We can only hope that the Democrats grow a spine and actually do something about it this time.

But the 2000 election was undoubtedly *rigged* -- not just ""gaming the system"" like *every* politician does, but flat-out illegally rigged. That makes 2016 very different than 2000 since I haven't read/heard anything about Trump committing crimes to win. (Unlike Hillary whose campaign committed clear, federal electoral crimes in her attempt to win.)

Like it or not, Trump ran a highly unorthodox but brilliant campaign tapping into the disgust of Americans.

Yes, white men overwhelmingly voted for Trump. But as testimony to just how shitty and lackluster the war criminal Hillary's campaign was, 53% of white *women* voted for Trump.

Think about that -- it's astounding. Hillary based her entire campaign on the idea that she should be coronated because she's a woman and had experience supporting American war crimes. But yet she could not even got a majority of white women to vote for her (it was clear black women weren't going to vote for a guy with the racist history of Trump).

16400,2016-11-14 04:14:38,The Consequences of Third-Party Voting,,2016-11-14 04:15:02,AmericanPolitics,t3_5cu3c7,"The consequences of third party voting are fairly straightforward — the individual you voted for receives one more vote and those you didn’t vote for get one less vote. Unfortunately, many people are trying to obscure this rather simple case of cause-and-effect with elaborate explanations of how third party votes really supported Donald Trump. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after Trump’s stunning win on Tuesday, a number of Democrats have unleashed a steady stream of vitriol against third-party voters. Many have tried to paint Donald Trump’s win as a direct consequence of people voting for the Libertarian and Green Party candidates. Others have immaturely tried to characterize third-party votes as protest votes. And some others have arrogantly tried to characterize third-party voters as nothing more than spoilers. Throughout these tirades, a common theme has emerged — those that lost are refusing to take responsibility for their loss.

**Third party votes are not the problem; they are a result of the problem.**

Arguments about the efficacy of the Electoral College aside, the election results delivered a clear result. Donald Trump won. Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Evan McMullin lost. People try to obscure the results by saying Johnson or Stein took votes away from Clinton, thereby causing her to lose and Trump to win. By that logic, Trump took votes from Clinton. It’s amazing this isn’t clearer to some, but the fact is you can’t take something from someone that they don’t already have. No one took votes from Clinton — she didn’t own those votes, the people casting them did. And people cast their votes in the manner in which they chose, as is their right. Third-party voters did not cost Clinton the election, nor did they help elect Donald Trump. The reality is Republicans and Democrats had a chance, but failed to convince those inclined to vote for Trump, Johnson, Stein, or McMullin to vote otherwise.

Even if one agrees with the assertion that third party candidates “took” votes from Clinton, they’d have to acknowledge that at least some votes were also “taken” from Trump. After all, many long-time Republicans were publicly distancing themselves from Trump throughout the campaign. Poll results have shown that many of the key races were tight, but the votes don’t calculate what might have happened. Only the individual voter knows how they might have voted. Therefore, assuming that third party votes only drew away from Clinton is nothing more than speculation, and poor speculation at that.

**A Cognitive Bias**

Decades of political experience, years of planning, and incredible funding all fell short of winning the election. Blaming this loss on external factors is subjective and arrogant. Those who insist on laying blame need to be objective, they need to look no further than the Democratic Party itself. Democrats failed to motivate enough voters, they failed to anticipate the strength of Donald Trump’s backing, and they failed to engage third-party voters on the issues important to them. These failures are truly amazing considering that Clinton had four decades of political experience and a coalesced party rallying behind her, while Trump had an extremely fractured Republican base bickering behind him. In addition to the arrogance, accusing third party voters of causing Clinton’s loss overlooks a glaring fact — an estimated 43% of eligible voters didn’t vote. Surely, their inaction had an impact on the outcome. Undoubtedly, some of them would have voted for Clinton.

Democrats were certainly ready to own the win they expected; now it’s time to own the loss. This election loss may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it won’t be made any easier by blaming others. Rather than labeling third-party voters as protestors and spoilers and laying the blame for your loss at their feet, why not begin courting those voters. Similar to the broad vilification of Trump supporters as racists, misogynists, and deplorable, attempting to de-legitimize third-party voters has backfired and will certainly backfire again. If Democrats want third-party votes they’ll have to earn them. They can start trying to earn them today by treating third-party voters and their issues with respect.

**Consequences**

There certainly are consequences to voting third party, but Trump’s election and Clinton’s loss are not among them. Voting third party was a rational choice for those that chose to do so; it was a respectable way to voice your opinion and let the system know that there are more than two choices; it was responsible participation in a democracy. Those that chose to vote third-party should be proud of their role and not let the sting of others defeat make them regretful.

I was going to say the exact same thing. With global warming, we don't need any more hot air.

Actions speak louder than words.

The 2-for-1 regulation idea is absurd, and is based on the idea that all regulations are equal or that most are somehow bad.

Just get rid of the ""bad"" regulations and keep the ""good"" ones, and argue over the definition of good and bad (that's called ""politics""). Implementing such a simple-minded math formula is an insult to anyone with a brain.

&gt; doesn't address why he feels the need to fill his cabinet with deplorables

That's a straight judgment call opinion. (You'd think that the election would have taught people about mindlessly smearing others as ""deplorables,"" but I guess not.)

That's a legit spin one could put on that biography.

Another equally legitimate spin would be to describe him as a person whose father was a CIA asset and who was educated in the US specifically for the US to gain influence in Kenya; with Obama likely being at least associated with the CIA in one of the jobs Obama worked at; and with Obama only getting into one of the elite training grounds for the US ruling class (Harvard) because of his father's legacy status; that man -- the ""constitutional lawyer"" who kills Americans without charges or trial, who refuses to enforce our laws and prosecute everyone from banksters to torturers, and who doesn't have a principle he's not willing to horse-trade away -- that man rose up and became president of the US.

Needless to say, I think Obama is a complete disgrace.

But it is quite nice that we have broken the ""color barrier"" about having a black man as president. That's nice. It's just too bad it wasn't with a black man who possessed leadership skills and integrity.

&gt; Right-wing extremists in Miami, Florida celebrated the death of the former Cuban president Fidel Castro, with many brandishing signs bearing Donald Trump&amp;#039;s name, revealing the affinities between supporters of the U.S. President-elect and those who oppose the Cuban Revolution.

&gt; The Cuban government has not responded to the comments made by the two U.S. politicians, however their words show a lack of respect and diplomacy from both and possibly offer glimpse of how the Trump administration will behave toward the communist island.

&gt; Obama, who in March became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba in 88 years, extended &amp;quot;a hand of friendship to the Cuban people&amp;quot; after the death of the revolutionary icon was confirmed.

&gt; In addition to the reality that Carrier intends to send nearly twice as many jobs to Mexico as will remain in Indiana, and in addition to Trump and Pence paying Carrier $7 million in state tax breaks for doing so, the deal sets a troubling precedent.

&gt; We should be happy, I suppose, for the 800 workers who&amp;#039;ll keep their jobs, but at what ultimate expense to American manufacturing?

&gt; Donald Trump seems to me a textbook illustration of how a lifelong campaign of self-congratulation and self-aggrandizement represents an attempt to compensate for deeply rooted insecurity.

&gt; WASHINGTON The overseers of the U.S. intelligence community have not embraced a CIA assessment that Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Republican President-elect Donald Trump win the 2016 election, three American officials said on Monday.

&gt; The position of the ODNI, which oversees the 17 agency-strong U.S. intelligence community, could give Trump fresh ammunition to dispute the CIA assessment, which he rejected as &amp;quot;Ridiculous&amp;quot; in weekend remarks, and press his assertion that no evidence implicates Russia in the cyber attacks.

&gt; In an angry letter sent to ODNI chief Clapper on Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he was &amp;quot;Dismayed&amp;quot; that the top U.S. intelligence official had not informed the panel of the CIA&amp;#039;s analysis and the difference between its judgment and the FBI&amp;#039;s assessment.

This is incorrect.  Secretary Clinton is less likely to win if the electors revolt than Donald Trump.  Why?  The election will be decided by state delegations in the house of representatives.  Whether that's the 2016 or 2017 version, I'd say that if we have no candidate with 270, the odds are:

Protest Republican 60%
Trump 39.9%
Clinton 0.1%

I don't know exactly who, other than the democrats (who would make up a minority) would advocate for Clinton.  Very likely, Clinton states would, after a deadlocked first ballot, start to back the Protest Republican that finished third in the EC in order to stop Trump.  Washington, for example, is a Clinton state that almost certainly would go ""purple"" in the house.",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

&gt; Gingrich suggested Congress should consider changing ethics laws so Trump can freely intermingle his business interests and duties as president.

&gt; Trump also hasn&amp;#039;t indicated any willingness to address the constitutional issue posed by his continued ownership of the Trump International hotel in Washington, D.C. Not divesting means Trump will be accepting money from foreign governments and hence violating the Constitution on his first day in office.

As such, I expect him to do what every other president does. He'll be murdering people without trial by drone strikes and trashing civil liberties just like Bush and Obama, he'll be doing lots of other crimes, and he'll be rewarding his friends with jobs and access.

Icke is of the same vein, only nuttier.

Here is what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke) says, *in part,* about this fascist, lizard-people-believing nut job:

&gt; A former footballer[1] and sports broadcaster, Icke has been known since the 1990s as a professional conspiracy theorist,[2] calling himself a ""full time investigator into who and what is really controlling the world.""[3] He is the author of over 20 books and numerous DVDs, and has lectured in over 25 countries, speaking for up to 10 hours to audiences that cut across the political spectrum.[4][5]  

&gt; Icke was a BBC television sports presenter and spokesman for the Green Party, when a psychic told him, in 1990, that he had been placed on Earth for a purpose and would begin to receive messages from the spirit world.[6] The following year he announced that he was a ""Son of the Godhead"",[1] and that the world would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes, a prediction he repeated on the BBC's primetime show Wogan.[7][8] The show changed his life, turning him from a respected household name into someone who was laughed at whenever he appeared in public.[9]  

&gt; Over the next 11 years—in The Robots' Rebellion (1994), And the Truth Shall Set You Free (1995), The Biggest Secret (1999), and Children of the Matrix (2001)—he developed his worldview of New Age conspiracism.[10] His endorsement of the antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in The Robots' Rebellion, combined with Holocaust denial in And the Truth Shall Set You Free, led his publisher to refuse to publish his books, which were self-published thereafter.[11] At the heart of his theories lies the idea that many prominent figures belong to the Babylonian Brotherhood, a group of shapeshifting reptilian humanoids who are propelling humanity toward a global fascist state, or New World Order.[6][12] The reptilians use the rings of Saturn and the Moon, all reptilian constructs, to broadcast our ""five-sense prison"": an ""artificial sense of self and the world"" that humans perceive as reality.[13][14]  

&gt; Michael Barkun has described Icke's position as New Age conspiracism, writing that Icke is the most fluent of the genre.[15] Richard Kahn and Tyson Lewis argue that Icke's reptilian hypothesis may be Swiftian satire, offering a narrative with which ordinary people can question what they see around them.[16]  

&gt; Icke has been described as an antisemitic conspiracy theorist;[17] according to Political Research Associates, his politics are ""a mishmash of most of the dominant themes of contemporary neofascism, mixed in with a smattering of topics culled from the U.S. militia movement.""[11] Campaign Against Antisemitism refers to Icke as ""a modern-day antisemitic hate preacher who uses social media, his books and his stage performances to incite hatred towards Jewish people.""[18]",1,['Donald Trump'],[],[]

So what you're saying is that she is either lying or refusing to answer a question asked by the US Congress. Congress should hold her in contempt.

You can play games rationalizing this, but the fact of the matter is that she is a war criminal who should be put on trial.

Instead, under our immoral government, she will be *promoted* and her promotion will have votes from *both* Republicans and Democrats.

And we can all thank the Barack Obama for this. Obama's cowardly refusal to enforce the law which outlaws torture, both US domestic law and int'l treaty, is why she's getting a promotion and not a prison cell.

&gt; How would they accept her as the Director if she decries their actions?

I don't care if they accept her or not. They're *gov't employees.*

If they do not ""accept"" their boss they should be fired. And if they're so powerful that they cannot be fired then the entire agency should be abolished.

Patriot?! Wash your mouth out with soap for saying that. Trump is a literal **traitor** to the US. Honestly look at his track record.

Trump refused to be drafted to go fight our criminal war on Vietnam. He used multiple deferments, and then finally used ""bone spurs"" to avoid being sent to war.

When traitor Trump murdered the Iranian general Iran responded by a massive missile barrage on the 2 largest American bases in Iraq -- remember that? Over 100 American soldiers were injured as a result of that combat.

But Donald Trump got on TV and then belittled and insulted the US soldiers who he had put into harm's way, calling their injures nothing but ""headaches."" When given the chance to walk back his smearing of US soldiers injured in battle, Trump doubled down, repeating his ""headaches"" insult and *ignoring the fact* that many of the 100+ troops injured in battle had to be medically-evacuated from Iraq to Germany and some even brought back to the US for medical care!

Is that ""patriotic"" -- is it ""patriotic to talk trash about soldiers wounded in combat?! Tell us that blowhard SpecOpsAlpha.

Traitor Trump in one of only 3 presidents in our 200+ year history to be impeached -- is that ""patriotic""?

The dishonorable US Senate -- without calling a single witness or hearing testimony (because the right-wing war hawk Bolton would testify he heard traitor Trump utter the quid pro quo deal from the president's own lips) -- set the political precedent that a US president can publicly call [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQb2S4DIcNc) and [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcD5sttJ-sQ) again for foreign gov'ts to interfere in US politics and investigate his chief political rival.

Is that MAGA? Seriously, answer that question.

It doesn't matter how corrupt Biden is. For an FBI guy or US prosecuting attorney to request Ukraine, or Russia or China to investigate the corrupt Bidens is fine -- but for *the president* to do it repeatedly and publicly is insane; it's a horrible political precedent to set. 

Do we really want to set the precedent that the US president can publicly call on foreign gov'ts to investigate the guy that's likely to be their campaign opponent? Aren't foreign gov'ts likely to lie depending on how much money they can get?

Would you be okay for a President Biden in 2021 to call on foreign gov'ts to investigate former president Trump or Mitch McConnell or some other popular Republican? That is the precedent now set by the US Senate.

I knew Elizabeth Warren when I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She was a right-wing Reaganite. And the University of Pennsylvania had the most progressive law school curriculum in the country. And this is Elizabeth Warren. And I taught a first year class called income security. Elizabeth Warren said “there is no more ridiculous idea than national healthcare.” That's the Elizabeth Warren I knew. She was in her 30s at this time. She was the henchwoman of the right-wing takeover to destroy the left-wing curriculum. I taught Worker's Rights, I taught the National Labor Rights Act, which doesn’t exist anymore, for the most part, it's not taught in any law school in the United States, I taught Income Security, and I taught Jurisprudence. Elizabeth was against all those things. I don't really know Elizabeth Warren personally, I just know her as a right-wing Republican. **And somehow or another, God came out of the heavens and turned her into a Democrat, probably at the very moment that Derrick Bell stepped down from Harvard because he would not work anymore until they hired an African-American woman. Now she couldn't pretend she was Black, so she pretended -She was Native American. That's not what we call people who are Native Americans, because they’re First Nations people. Apaches and Cherokees were nations. There's no such thing as a Native American. Elizabeth checked that box just as Derrick Bell was stepping down. She goes to Massachusetts and she becomes a Democrat.** There is no more [of a] relentless, ruthless, nihilist that I have ever met in my entire life. Not Elizabeth Warren. She's right up there with Donald Trump. So I can't really support her. She did succeed in destroying that progressive curriculum. And that progressive curriculum is, you know, it’s one of those life things that you hold onto, right?
So I don't trust Elizabeth Warren as far as I can throw her. She has no policy, she doesn't understand imperialism, and she has said she's a capitalist. What she really is is a technocrat who clawed her way to Harvard. I mean, that’s where you want to end up, right? If you're a law professor, you want to be at Harvard. Ok, she did that. She succeeded. But as President of the United States I wouldn't even dream of supporting her. Because Bernie Sanders, whatever you think of him, like me, was chaining himself to schools to [de]segregate them. Was protesting against the Vietnam war.

As advisers were trying to warn the President and executive branch agencies about what was coming, and how to prepare for it, most of the rest of us didn't know or understand yet, nor did we have steps to take to prepare.  We expect the government to handle the things it is designed to do, and this is one of them, and we expect the government to evaluate information (including science) and inform us of what we should know, as well.  Impeachment itself could've continued, of course, in January, without preventing any of the necessary steps, but already in January, the government should've put together a task force with clear leadership to coordinate agencies, warned the public that a pandemic response would be coming and what it could look like, put real resources into setting up testing (not just developing a test, but the actual logistics of where and how it could be done at massive scale), put together a plan for ramping up production of masks and sanitizer and other important supplies - including how to use the Defense Production Act if necessary, and connected with the public health agency of every state to make a coordinated plan with them.  None of that happened, not even a shred of it, and not in February either.  And as this article details but as we also already knew from numerous other articles and Trump and Kushner's own words on many occasions, they just didn't take it seriously and didn't want to do any of the above things.

&gt; (1) any links and/or coordination

Donald Trump; and

&gt; (2) any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation"" (the Investigation).

So Flynn's falsehoods about the Russian ambassador are part a, and the falsehoods about his work for Turkey are part b.

&gt; the Government has concluded that the interview of Mr. Flynn was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn—a no longer justifiably predicated investigation that the FBI had, in the Bureau’s own words, prepared to close because it had yielded an “absence of any derogatory information.”

I don't buy that. The counter intelligence investigation was focused on finding corrupt relationships between officials in the Trump campaign and Russia.

Flynn lied about discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador. I feel that alone is “reasonably likely to influence the tribunal in making a determination required to be made.”

&gt; In the FARA filings, FLYNN made materially false statements and omissions, including by falsely stating that (a) FIG did not know whether or the extent to which the Republic of Turkey was involved in the Turkey project, (b) the Turkey project was focused on improving U.S. business organizations' confidence regarding doing business in Turkey, and (c) an op-ed by FLYNN published in The Hill on November 8, 2016, was written at his own initiative; and by omitting that officials from the Republic of Turkey provided supervision and direction over the Turkey project.

That's BS -- it's a bogus claim attempting to defend our treasonous president.

But don't take my word for it. Snopes address the issue fully: [Did Trump Administration Fire the US Pandemic Response Team?](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/) Reuters addresses the issue [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-trump-fired-pandemic-team-idUSKBN21C32M) and Politicfact addresses the question, [Did Donald Trump fire pandemic officials, defund CDC?](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/)

&gt; Attempting to balance a real response with not inducing more panic than the media had already created.

Again, traitor Trump played politics with the pandemic -- how else can you call labeling it the Democrats' ""hoax""?

Do you really think when he was lying to the public about us soon going down to 0 cases, that he was telling the truth to spare us from ""panic""? Wouldn't it be more responsible to clue the country in with what was coming so that workers and businesses could take preparations?

Instead the blowhard was lying to the public in February that “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

If he was doing a great job, wouldn't he have been using his presidential powers to order industry to produce masks, respirators and other PPE instead of wasting time for a month and *letting thousands of Americans die?*

Instead our clueless braggart just tried to lie his way out of it, saying in March “This blindsided the world” and claiming “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it...Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability.

* Flynn was under investigation for espionage on behalf of a foreign power beginning August 2016. There is zero evidence that this investigation was initiated by Obama.
* Flynn was known to have close ties to various Kremlin figures, so the fact that he was also an official foreign policy adviser to a major party's presidential nominee was a major concern.

This clip of Watters' World covers the [#ObamaGate](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ObamaGate&amp;src=trend_click) scandal as it is heavily trending on social media, as truth continues to come to light. The scandal implicates that Obama and his administration illegally spied on and created fake news misinformation against Trump &amp; General Michael Flynn stating they were traitors. There was no basis to even investigate in the first place and Trump defines this unpatriotic behaviour as treason meaning it is only a matter of time until we see some arrests for those involved in this coup d'état.

Its right there. Flynn's FARA submission can be found [here](https://efile.fara.gov/docs/6406-Registration-Statement-20170307-1.pdf).

&gt; There is none the 302 has gone 'missing' and the current one was edited by non FBI personal, with an admitted bias to 'Prevent Trump'.

What does that have to do with a false FARA?

&gt; Obama was aware of that felony which makes him culpable. He knew about the FBI trying to set a perjury trap before it happened. 

What 'felony' is Obama aware of? How is being 'aware' of a felony a crime?

You then link to another PJMedia story that once again fails to name the crime.

Let me spell this out for you, its easy. When [Trump solicited Russia for help in finding Clinton's emails](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-asked-russia-to-find-clintons-emails-on-or-around-the-same-day-russians-targeted-her-accounts), he was violating campaign finance law. Specifically, Trump violated 52 USC 30121: Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.

&gt; (a) Prohibition

&gt; It shall be unlawful for-

&gt; (1) a foreign national, directly or indirectly, to make-

&gt; (A) a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election;

&gt; (B) a contribution or donation to a committee of a political party; or

&gt; (C) an expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement for an electioneering communication (within the meaning of section 30104(f)(3) of this title); or

&gt; (2) a **person to solicit**, accept, or receive a contribution or donation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) from a foreign national.

So what law did Obama break?

Trump has actually accomplished little in terms of legislation other than his tax cuts. (Biden is not proposing radical increased tax increases on the rich, is he?!) Trump's damage has mainly been done by destroying regulations which can easily be un-done by a future president -- but will Biden do that?

The left has actual options -- we can vote for the Green Party (will Biden do anything dramatic about global warming?) or one of the other, smaller socialist or leftist parties.

However, I'd like to point a few things out. 

In regards to the idea that Biden was chosen to 'level out' Obama's progressive leanings, I'd direct you to this arcticle by Vox, a noted left-leaning source: 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2019/12/20/21026212/2020-democratic-primary-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-barack-obama 

It points out that Biden is running on the most progressive platform of a major part *in modern American history.* 

Now, Biden did back proposals to strengthen the chemical industry in Delaware. That is a fact, and it is regrettable. However, I should note that his campaign also includes a 1.7 *TRILLION* dollar anti-climate change proposal, which is both effective and easier to fund. *(This information can be found below, where I cite Biden's tax plan, also from Vox)*

As far as cuts on social security go, the primary source of this I can find is Biden being *willing to negotiate* with Conservatives to manage soaring national debts. There was also a misleadingly edited video of Biden speaking about Ryan's social security cuts that has contributed to this idea. Ive included a fact checker article below. 

https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/biden-vs-sanders-on-social-security-and-medicare/

In respect to militarism, the Senate was *lied to* about Iraq. There was was no reason to disbelieve members of our own government about the information presented, that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction for use on neighboring nations, and harboring terrorists that had just wroght destruction on ours. He was acting as someone concerned for global and national security, with the, regrettably false, information that he had. I am in no way saying the Iraq War was justified or well handled, simply that it wasn't hawkishness that led to his vote-- throughout the war, he criticized the Bush administration for not exhausting diplomatic solutions.
And, I should note to back this up, he did vote against the first Gulf War. 

As far as the PATRIOT act goes, thats another regrettable mark on Biden's three-decade career. But anyone that has been in politics for that long will have mistakes. We must remember, even our leaders are human, and no ""good"" presidential candidate will ever match up with all of our ideas 

Finally, as far as medicare goes, Biden support ""Healthcare for all who want it."" People may chose to keep their private insurance, as opposed to having it nationalized. I, personally, though I support a public option and believe it will eventually outcompete private options, diagree with the seizure of private insurance options simply on principle. A public option forced to compete will be one made such that it provides the best care, and avoids exorbitant cost that would raise the national debt. 

As far as tax cuts go, Biden does plan to hike taxes on the rich to fund his plans, as you can read below: 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2019/12/5/20995225/joe-biden-tax-plan

I wouldn't call any of the above a disgrace. I would call it a moderate progressive in a *fundamentally* conservative nation trying to push that nation to the left in a sustainable way. Nevertheless, he's still running on the most progressive ticket of a major party in history-- and that's an important point: *major* party. 

I agree that the United States' two party system is frustrating, and confining. I agree we have a politicocorporate aristocracy in our legistlature and an elected monarchy as our executive. But the way to fix this is not to vote for people that, realistically, don't have a chance. And if the justification for doing that is ""it would work if only more people would do it,"" it's not a proper justification, because in reality, most people don't vote for 3rd parties, and when they do, they split the vote, and the greater of two evils gets elected. 

Joe Biden is someone who *can* get elected, and who *can* beat Donald Trump, if the left comes out for him. No, he's not ideal. His steps are baby steps. But I disagree with the assertion that Donald Trump's presidency has not been damaging. He lies every day. He weakens Democracy on the world stage and further entrenches unregulated vulture capitalism. He stacks the courts with people even you must acknowledge are radical quasifascists. He licenses outright racism. He institutionalizes homophobia and conspiracy. He relentlessly attacks the press and flouts seperation of powers, the idea of being a civil servant, and rule of law. In short, he erodes the very foundations of our democracy in a manner Im not sure we could recover from eight years of.

Electing Joe Biden wouldn't be the biggest progressive leap forward, hardly even a shuffle. But, its better than the uncontrollable backslide we risk with another 4 years of Donald Trump. Joe Biden IS a moderate, but a strength of moderates is that they can bring people together-- which is what this nation desperately needs. And his election can return us to a place where the whole country can shift left, as opposed to hyperpartisan radical action that results in an opposite hyperpartisan reactionism. 

I'm not trying to browbeat. When it comes down to it, vote for who you do. But I honestly believe nearly anything is better than Donald Trump at this point. That's why I respectfully ask you to back Joe Biden in the fall. Thats how we can began to change the system in a lasting way-- with baby steps.",2,['Joe Biden'],[],"['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']"

* In the ""progressive era"" after WWI the Progressive Party and the Socialist Party forced the political spectrum to the left. In that era we won the right of women to vote and direct popular election of US senators.

* In the 1930s the then-fast growing Communist Party and Socialist Party forced FDR to enact a swath of laws benefiting ""we the people."" Communists militantly moving evicted people back into the homes that sheriffs evicted them from, and a few Socialist Party US Congressmen helped shift the entire political spectrum and resulted in SS, unemployment insurance, the 40 hour workweek and everything else FDR managed to do.

* In the 1960s the militant Black Panther Party and a swath of small leftist parties (e.g. the ""Yippies"") along with social movements again shifted the political spectrum, giving LBJ room to pass his Great Society programs.

The third party dynamic also works for the right too!

* In the late 1990s Ross Perot's center-right Reform Party shocked the 2 ruling parties by getting 19% of the popular vote! Bill Clinton, who ran as a liberal, immediately became an austerity-minded budget hawk as *both* of our ruling parties moved to address the budget and coopt Perot's key issue. So the Democrat Clinton gleefully killed FDR's welfare program and managed to balance a couple of budgets. And then our 2 corrupt ruling parties closed off the TV debates so we no longer see 3rd party candidates (Perot embarrassed them!).

Start with the basics. This is an election for president of the United States. It has been going on for a long time. It started in January with the first votes cast in November.  

We are now in may and the candidates are chosen...we are down to two men who could possibly win the election...one Democrat and one Republican...just like in 2016 there are no other parties who could possibly get even one electoral vote...so pick one. 

People like you are not going to vote...you have no candidate...you have no party...you by your own choice are disenfranchised...you do not mater.

While they are running the newest project without me, I go and start something new and so on.

[***Thomas Wright***](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/thomas-wright/)***,*** *Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution*

In a recent campaign[ ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmieUrXwKCc#action=share), Joe Biden accused the president of being too soft on China over COVID-19. This decision to criticize Donald Trump on China and subsequent signals that Biden will take a tough approach toward Beijing have made some progressives nervous.

Writing in *The Atlantic*, Peter Beinart[ called](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/futility-bidens-china-hawkery/610285/) Biden’s ad “a jingoistic fantasy” that may put Asian Americans in the crosshairs of racist attacks, “hastening a geopolitical confrontation that threatens progressive goals.” In *The New York Times*, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft scholars Rachel Esplin Odell and Stephen Wertheim[ warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/opinion/china-coronavirus-trump.html) Biden about following Trump into a new cold war with China and argued that the United States should seek to work with Beijing on shared challenges such as pandemics and climate change.

Critics of Biden’s China policy are proposing far-reaching U.S.-China cooperation that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent diplomatic record suggests is chimerical at best. Yes, the United States should have a bilateral relationship with China and the two countries should cooperate on shared interests, including pandemics, but the proposition that a cooperative world lies just beyond the horizon if only the United States were to want it enough is not borne out by the evidence. And any progressive foreign policy needs to be based on a realistic assessment of China’s record.

Just ask the Europeans. Their experience proves that such cooperation has real limits and that China is constantly looking to exploit any perceived weakness or division. The European Union has no meaningful ability to counter Chinese power militarily. It is diplomatically cautious and hardwired to support engagement with Beijing. Its strategic assessments go out of their way to be nuanced and balanced. Last year, a key EU document[ said](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/communication-eu-china-a-strategic-outlook.pdf):

&gt;China is, simultaneously, in different policy areas, a cooperation partner with whom the EU has closely aligned objectives, a negotiating partner with whom the EU needs to find a balance of interests, an economic competitor in the pursuit of technological leadership, and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance.

Although this may sound as if the EU is trying to have it all ways with China, this wording was widely interpreted as a toughening of Europe’s position.

Even as the EU tried to formulate a united approach to protect against pressure from Beijing, it sought to distinguish itself from the United States with an ambitious and pragmatic policy agenda for cooperation with China. This year was supposed to see the first ever summit, in Leipzig, Germany, among the heads of government of all 27 EU member states and President Xi, with negotiations on a comprehensive EU-China investment agreement at its heart. When the coronavirus hit in January, the EU quietly assisted China and refrained from any criticism of its regime, in the hopes that doing so would build goodwill.

In other words, the official EU posture and the bloc’s practical policy toward China, even as it hardened, was far softer and more benign than any imaginable U.S. approach. European governments were going to great lengths to see if engagement would yield new levels of cooperation on shared challenges, but they were continuously and sorely disappointed.

Well before the COVID-19 crisis, EU governments were growing more and more worried about China’s behavior. They realized that while Chinese state-backed companies and funds aggressively increased their presence in Europe, China would not undertake structural economic reform to open up to Europe. Beijing sought to divide the EU, developing ties with Central and Eastern Europe while pressuring recipients of Chinese investment, such as Greece and Hungary, to block or stymie EU actions Beijing disapproved of on human-rights or investment controls. China also began to flex its muscles to mute any criticism of the regime by governments, companies, or individuals. For instance, the Chinese broadcaster CCTV[ refused](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/15/football/mesut-ozil-arsenal-china-uyghur-media-spt-intl/index.html) to air an English Premier League soccer match after an Arsenal player, Mesut Özil, spoke out against detention camps in Xinjiang. When Swedish PEN awarded a freedom-of-speech prize to the Chinese-born and Hong Kong–based Swedish citizen Gui Minhai, the Chinese embassy in Stockholm fiercely[ denounced](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/18/china-threatens-sweden-after-gui-minhai-wins-free-speech-award) it and warned that Sweden would “suffer the consequences.” These were not isolated incidents, and they gradually began to change European attitudes.

As Andrew Small, a scholar with the German Marshall Fund and European Council on Foreign Relations, shows in a new[ paper](https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_meaning_of_systemic_rivalry_europe_and_china_beyond_the_pandemic) on EU-China relations, Beijing further escalated these exploitation efforts once China could turn its attention away from the coronavirus. China sought to take economic advantage of Europe’s vulnerability during the pandemic by trying to buy European technology companies. Chinese ambassadors—nicknamed *Wolf Warrior* diplomats, after the nationalistic action movie—went on the offensive, accusing the French government of letting its elderly citizens die in nursing homes and of spreading the falsehood that the [U.S. Army had brought the virus to China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html). German officials complained that China was insisting on public declarations of support in exchange for its assistance. The Chinese foreign ministry demanded that the state-owned China Daily [delete a sentence](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/china/eu-china-coronavirus-oped-censored-intl/index.html) on the origins of the coronavirus in an op-ed by EU ambassadors to China.

###CLINTON PURGERED HIMSELF 11 TIMES JACKASS EACH ONE DIRECTLY IMPEACHABLE PLUS WITNESS TAMPERING AND OBSTRUCTION ON TOP OF IT. ALL RED HANDED COLD BUSTED.

The Starr Report, presented on Sept. 9,1998, presented **11 impeachable offenses**. Bill Clinton was eventually charged because he ""...willfully provided perjuries, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury,"" and made ""...corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence.""

The first of the possible offenses presented in the Starr Report was that President **Clinton had lied under oath** during the civil case when he denied any sort of sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. The President also lied under oath to the grand jury about his sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.

He also lied in a civil deposition about ever having been alone with Ms. Lewinsky and the gifts that he had exchanged with her. There was evidence of him discussing the Jones case with Ms. Lewinsky as well. Throughout the course of the Jones case, **Bill Clinton obstructed justice with Ms. Lewinsky by jointly concealing the truth of their relationship**.

**Clinton attempted to obstruct justice by helping Monica Lewinsky get a job in New York when her witness could be detrimental if she told the truth in the Jones case**. The President lied again under oath in his discussions with Vernon Jordan regarding Ms. Lewinsky's involvement in the Jones case.

Following this civil disposition, President **Clinton attempted to tamper with a potential witness** by influencing his secretary. Refusing to testify for seven months was an attempt to obstruct justice during the grand jury investigation. Finally, President Clinton abused his constitutional authority in several ways throughout the course of the investigation.",1,[],[],['Bill Clinton']

It's basically a meta analysis of opinion polls from across the USA.   It's a measure of how many people approve of Trump at this moment.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with who voted for him or against him during the election or how people intend to vote in the future.  It is simple a measure of approval or disapproval right now.  

And while they are entirely irrelevant, it's probably worth mentioning that your population and voting figures are also incorrect.  There is in fact 330,848,770 residents of the USA as at June 2, not 350 million.   And 62,979,879 people voted for Trump, not 64 million.    Which is about 20 per cent of the population.  So unless you were calling bullshit on the 40 per cent I mentioned trying to suggest it was higher, then that was probably an unwise choice of ammunition to bring to the debate.    Probably best to compare the number of voters rather than total population when you are trying to magically generate support for Bunker Boy, don't you think?

To suggest the graph is bullshit without actually looking at it was pretty stupid really.  But then to make that suggestion based on population and voting figures which are entirely irrelevant, well that really does display a level of dullness rarely seen outside the USA.  And then, to compound what is already some pretty impressive vacuousness, the figures you quote are wrong.   Could probably call that tertiary stupidity.

Trump: *""Well I think it's a very sad problem as you know as a Republican I'm doing very well with African Americans and with the vote - with the - in polls and everything.  Especially, I mean I haven't seen one very recently because you had the plague come in from China. So that changed things up.""*

Asked again: How will you handle the law enforcement problem?

Trump: *""I've spoken about it numerous times in various speeches and, you know, it's interesting I spoke about it when we launched a very successful rocket, a tremendous program that culminated on that day and obviously goes on from there.  But I then made a speech and it was a speech about the rocket and I devoted 25% of the speech probably to what happened or more to what happened with respect to George - George Floyd.""*

&gt;Here's a number that should terrify every Republican on the ballot this fall

With all the focus on a slew of new polls that show President Donald Trump falling further behind former Vice President Joe Biden, one number has largely slipped through the cracks -- and it is a blaring warning signal to Republicans on the ballot this fall.
Here it is: 51% of registered voters said they would prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats in 2021, while just 40% preferred a Republican-controlled Congress, according to a new Wall Street Journal-NBC poll released Sunday. That marks a change in Democrats' favor from January when the party had just a 6-point edge over the GOP on what is known as the ""generic ballot"" question.

For those blocked by paywall:

[***By Hasan Chowdhury***](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/hasan-chowdhury/) ***and*** [***Hannah Boland***](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/hannah-boland/)

***22 June 2020 • 5:52pm***

It's the world's goofiest social media platform.

Since TikTok's launch in China in 2016, the video streaming app's popularity has exploded, giving rise to a strange new world of lip-synced dance routines, cat videos and other oddball content that keeps hundreds of millions of bored teenagers and young adults mesmerised.

But with 800m active users - including 45m in the US, the social media app owned by Chinese tech giant Bytedance, is now evolving into something less inane: a potentially powerful political tool in a tightly fought US presidential election which is just five months away.

With droves of young users starting to use the app to influence or discuss politics, could TikTok be to 2020 what other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter were to the 2016 US election?

There are signs this is already starting to happen. On Saturday, a Donald Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, [attracted a crowd of just 6,500 supporters](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/21/donald-trump-blames-protesters-media-embarrassingly-low-tulsa/) in a centre designed for almost 20,000. That’s despite Trump’s campaign manager tweeting there had been “over 1m ticket requests”. 

It was claimed that the discrepancy in numbers was down to activity from TikTok users disrupting the proceedings. Many young users, left-leaning Generation Z teenagers or “Zoomers”, responded to calls from TikTok user MaryJo Laupp to reserve tickets and leave them empty so Trump would be “standing there alone”.  

Though some questions have been raised about the real impact of the scheme, with  Trump's election team denying any impact, it's clear that some TikTok users are not just looking for distractions but are using the platform to mobilise politically. 

Sophia Ignatidou, an academy associate at Chatham House, claims the Tulsa campaign event will serve as a “game-changer”  in terms of how the platform is viewed. 

“I haven't been paying much attention to TikTok but this incident made me realise I have to,” she says. “Until now it hasn't been a major player in terms of how elections or political campaigns can be affected.”

Rob Grey, a TikTok user with over 114,000 followers who has gained more than 1.2m video likes with a parody of a middle-aged white woman named “Karen”, has witnessed the app’s evolution to not just being about “silly viral videos” but a place where people can “share current affairs and their own personal views”. 

“I think it’s fair to say that what with all that’s happened this year, the community has been very reactive,” he says. “Given the scale of potential viewers, content creators are realising the influential power of the app.”

Others have turned the app’s usual gimmicks into more potent tools of political expression.

US comedian Sarah Cooper is using the platform as a powerful tool to lampoon the President, creating  viral lip-synced videos  which have attracted huge followings online.

Evan Berger, a user with 1.8m followers, has attracted attention with a political satire series that imagines Trump and Barack Obama in any number of scenarios. The aim is to portray Trump as an inadequate leader.

While many mainstream TikTok users stick to the app for music videos and dancing, a growing subset of users, some users embrace “Alt TikTok” or “Elite TikTok”, promoting satire and often left-wing jokes. 

The use of TikTok as a platform to satirise politicians is a trend in the UK too. “People are starting to realise that TikTok is not just all about girls dancing,” Meggie Foster, whose videos during lockdown have [attracted a vast following, ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/hail-lockdown-stars-kept-spirits/)says. 

“For me, I’ve been watching the news far more often in lockdown, because you can’t really escape it. And, with videos like mine, I’d hope it makes politics much more accessible to people my generation and younger. We need to be involved in it.”

It is not just Foster who sees TikTok as a way for a new audience to become interested in politics. 

Sharon Kann, research director at Media Matters for America, says it provides an example of how active networks of users on an inherently social app can upend the traditional models of political messaging.

TikTok’s reach is vast. Since being launched in the US in 2018, the app has racked up an estimated 45 million monthly active users in the country, offering plenty of room for ideas to spread.

But, there are concerns too. Aside from satire and parody, TikTok is emerging as a platform to hold political debates and create so-called “Hype Houses” to spread political messages. 

And, according to Kann, the “viral” nature of content on TikTok is a challenge in an election because “just removing a piece of misinformation doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not on the platform”. 

“We've seen instances where there'll be a claim about coronavirus that is inaccurate or misinformation, and even if that video gets taken down, so much of TikTok is people copying videos or reacting to videos,” she says. 

Since the start of the pandemic, Kann’s team has seen evidence of coronavirus misinformation spreading via the platform, for example. Because of the algorithms which drive the video recommendations on the app, [viewing one such video could lead to many more appearing on a person’s feed. ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/kombucha-girl-life-changed-went-viral-tiktok/)

TikTok’s recommendation system works by considering a host of factors about users and how they interact with videos on the site. This includes the personal interests they register when they first sign up, as well as the accounts they follow and videos they like.

While users will not see multiple videos from one account one after the other, they are likely to be “recommended a video that's been well received by other users who share similar interests”. This means the number of people who see particular videos can quickly snowball. 

That political misinformation or propaganda could fly across the internet at the speed of other viral memes is sure to stoke concerns among US officials. 

“It's probably too early to say exactly how \[TikTok\] factors into polarisation, I know that recently there were internal reports from Facebook released that indicated that they were aware that their algorithm had a polarising effect,” Kann says. 

A more troubling issue to US politicians is likely to be TikTok’s Chinese ownership. Bytedance, the app’s owner, is the world's most valuable start-up, commanding a $100bn valuation, and is headquartered in Beijing. 

Already, US government agencies have been warned not to use the app over national security concerns, amid claims that some content may have been censored. Others worry about the level of data collection on vast numbers of US citizens by an opaque Chinese company.

TikTok did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Bytedance has seemingly taken steps to mitigate any concerns. It added[ Disney’s former head of streaming as TikTok’s new CEO,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/19/disneys-kevin-mayer-man-intensify-tiktoks-battle-against-facebook/) and has signalled it will have separate global headquarters to its owners, outside China. 

Yet, for many, this may not be enough. With a US election around the corner, and more attention than ever on social media sites, TikTok may be in for a rocky ride. 

“I expect there will be a big backlash because it's not a US company, it's a Chinese-owned company so it will be framed as well in an attempt by a foreign actor even though it is US teens who lead this,” Ignatidou says.",1,[],[],"['Barack Obama', 'Donald Trump']"

&amp;#x200B;

""Technology"" to lead the masses and support them has been eagerly studied after World War II.

This is established as ""Org activity"".

[http://psychodoc.eek.jp/abare/org.html](http://psychodoc.eek.jp/abare/org.html)

■Introduction to Orgology ""Technology of Emotional Org: Scapegoat Setting Technique""

・Trump does not protect American soldiers!

・Trump is not suitable for the US President!

&amp;#x200B;

The news this time is a clear ""public agitation"".

This is an operation to make President Trump a scapegoat and put the American people on his side.

&amp;#x200B;

■Directing a sense of crisis

Biden has declared to the Org's target (American citizens other than Trump supporters) that the United States will be a big deal if this situation continues.

&amp;#x200B;

■ Use of pass-through logic

Show the cause of the crisis to the public. This analysis is ""no need to pursue the truth.""

━ Biden considers pressing all the causes of the crisis against a predetermined person (President Trump), and takes up only such causes.

▽ Therefore, the key to success and failure is how plausible and sacrificial the cause can be imposed in this style.

&amp;#x200B;

■ Exposure of sacrificial evil

　Simply passing the cause of the crisis (the decline of the United States) to the sacrifice (President Trump) is not enough to induce the masses (other than Trump supporters) to overthrow the sacrifice (Trump supporters).

It is necessary to expose the personal sacrifice (President Trump) and to perform ""responsibility transfer"" in the form that is the cause of the crisis.

Therefore, the personal evil of the sacrifice (President Trump) is analyzed and extracted from various aspects such as moral, economic, and human. (""Personalization,"" ""Betrayal,"" ""dictatorship,"" ""sexually slutty,"" etc.)

Here, the format is that President Trump ""had left the bounty for US soldiers.""

Note that this exposure needs to encourage the public (Americans other than Trump supporters) to have a hatred for sacrifices (non-supporters). That is the driving force to overthrow and eliminate the sacrifice (President Trump).

&amp;#x200B;

■ Defeat the sacrifice

Next, stress that there is no other way to escape the crisis than to defeat and exile the sacrifice (President Trump), which is the symbol of this hatred.

For those who do not agree with this, sacrifice (President Trump = bad guy who neglects bounty for American soldiers)

Assert that it is a betrayal of fellows (other than Trump supporters = American citizens (that impression operation)) (that is, the same guilty as President Trump) (application of Org No. 1 formula)

&amp;#x200B;

■ Confirmation

　This type of org activity has little effect on the fly. Therefore, it is important to end with a confirmation action at the end.

　Inviting everyone to take symbolic actions, such as praising Suprechor and calling for Biden, along with a shout such as “Let's get up”, make a strong impression.

&amp;#x200B;

Are Americans stupid enough to be manipulated with this kind of poor deception information?

Isn't it possible to search for information, collect evidence, and think for myself, without relying on media information?

With a square screen right in front of you, you should be able to search for evidence for most information by searching for about 15 minutes.

Are you so incompetent?

&amp;#x200B;

It was rather Biden who lied to deceive the Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

Biden should be blamed.

Biden lied.

Based on uncertain information, he led the people and defeated Trump.

This caused Biden to undermine American democracy.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that a liar should not be eligible to become president.

＞So now Trump's best defense is the word of the Taliban. Trump often lies, I guess he is not eligible for the presidency.

 I want to show you a problem that Biden instigated the American people by setting up information warfare based on uncertain information.

\-----------

Two daughters of a New York podiatrist say that 50 years ago their father diagnosed President Donald Trump with bone spurs in his heels as a favor to the doctor's landlord, Fred Trump 

...

Critics have noted that Trump was an athlete who enjoyed playing football, baseball, squash, tennis and golf in the years before his medical deferment.  

""I was the best baseball player in New York when I was young,"" [Trump told interviewer Michael D'Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th67trdmNTY) in 2014. ""I was always the best at sports."" 

...

When asked which foot had the problem, Trump – who has claimed to have ""one of the greatest memories of all time"" – told reporters that [he could not remember](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/07/18/trump-slams-mccains-war-hero-status-family-leadership-summit/30343519/). His campaign later released a statement saying the spurs affected both feet.  

\-----------

And even if Trump were a genuine war hero, we'd still be left with the fact that he was told by John Bolton and others that the Russians were paying bounties for killing American soldiers, and his reaction was to ask that Russia be invited to re-join the G-7.

The inappropriately named 'Union' fell apart piece by piece, and on Christmas Day 1991 the flag of the USSR was lowered for the last time in Moscow, and the new flag of the Russian (once more) Federation went up the flagpole. 

The rest of the world rubbed its eyes and wondered. The Soviet Empire had been too strong to fall militarily, and given nuclear weaponry any foreign opponent would have had an empty 'victory' in any case. Many attempts at revolution to overthrow the puppet regimes had been made in the satellite countries, all of them crushed militarily or ending in less reform than the participants would have liked. Inside the USSR itself there had also been revolts, but the legacy of terror and pervasive government control had prevented them from being nothing but promptly crushed local events. 

Neither military defeat, revolution nor gradual reform seemed likely to fundamentally change the Empire. Yet in a few years it was all over. The collapse that nobody could have predicted happened in a relative flash. 

Today it seems that the older 'partner in crime' of the USSR, the American Empire, is also falling to pieces. Once more the process has begun at the periphery. Aside from a few populist right wing regimes and Israel the USA no longer has any reliable 'allies'. In Europe the right wing to neo-fascist parties are more beholden to Russia than the USA. Europe and others have recognized the USA as an unreliable, unpleasant ally, and are busy seeking new arrangements. Others presently 'under the American wing' such as Saudi Arabia have begun the process quietly, and their detachment from the Empire will grow. Turkey's Erdogan plays the Americans and Russia like a fiddle, aided by the fact that the USA no longer has any coherent plan to preserve its influence. As in the Middle East other parts of the world are increasingly seeking other international relations. 

Meanwhile, back in the Empire's center, America's 400 year sins are coming back to demand justice and a resolution. As with the USSR the ideological illusions are in tatters, and the fragmentation has travelled from the outlands to the center. The American Empire, of course, is older than that of the USSR, and its judgement day may be more prolonged. The final outcome, however, isn't in question. A new more multipolar world is being born before our eyes. 

Will it be utopia ? Of course not. The American Empire's opponents, foreign and domestic, will find that the final outcome of their dreams isn't what they imagined. Better or worse ? Who knows. It will, however, be very, very different.",2,['Donald Trump'],[],[]

tell us, comrade. if this magical party switch took place, why did it take a republican president to desegregate schools after the Civil Rights Act, while democrats like Joe Biden were pushing for segregation well into the 80s? Biden is still a democrat to this day. he didn't switch.

Republicans never did that. Republicans never defended slavery. Republicans never implemented Jim Crow. the KKK was a wing of the democrat party with millions of members. democrats hung blacks from trees, not Republicans. honestly it sounds like if there was a switch, that people become less racist as they become Republican. which would explain why democrats are still backing racial supremacy groups to this day.

* belittled US troops he had injured in battle mocking them as malingerers saying they just had ""headaches"" as they were medivaced across the world (!) for their combat injuries,

* the clown who [disbanded the Pandemic Response Team in 2018 saying that as a businessman he did not believe in paying people to sit around waiting for something bad to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX7HWy9rFrc) -- thus leaving the US completely unprepared for the long-predicted virus

* Trump now leaves office under a rape lawsuit, with the IRS auditing his taxes, with huge amounts of corruption in gov't (drain the swamp my ass!) and with roughly 1/4 million dead Americans all due to Trump's incompetence and inability to govern.

Sleepy Joe Biden is certainly no prize to be proud of, but it's hard to imagine him doing a *worse* job than traitor Trump.

Except I have a reason. You're spreading racist nonsense and propaganda, specifically against a movement that is fighting against being treated unfairly to the point of getting executed in the streets. 

&gt;If you have information that shows that President Trump's DOJ murdered Jeffrey Epstein then I encourage you to share it with some attorneys or perhaps the local police in New York. 

I don't have evidence, of course. I don't work for Bill Barr or Donald Trump. If I did, that would be easy. The fact remains that Epstein was murdered under the Republican DOJ and Donald Trump's watch. 

But please, keep trying to paint me as guilty for the things **we know Trump and Republicans** are guilty of. 

Reminder that Roy Moore got millions of Republican votes after it became known he was trolling the local mall for teenage girls of the age 14 and younger.

Also a reminder that Republicans collude with foreign governments to gain advantages. So they are not only pedophiles and criminals, they are also traitors. The only people who support them are racists and the uneducated.

23544,2020-07-16 04:00:15,101 Organizations Call on Congress to Enact $1.5 Trillion Student Debt Jubilee as Part of Covid-19 Relief,,2020-07-16 15:02:35,AmericanPolitics,t3_hs2sbl,"&gt; What I want to know is why is this even being considered.

Because student loan debt is killing our economy. Young people used to go to college, get an education, go into the workforce with good-paying jobs and **then buy things**.  Those young people became **middle-class consumers**.

But since the unelected-by-the-American-people, torturing war criminal George W. Bush opened up the student loan system to for-profit schools and allowed banksters to eagerly trap students into **debt peonage** the whole system changed.

Colleges started adding frills and the cost of tuition went through the roof! The colleges didn't care, because *clueless teenagers* were pressured into taking out *massive* student loans for increasingly worthless degrees and degrees that had little relationship to actual employment.

So now we have essentially an entire generation of college-educated students **who are not consumers** -- they're instead forced to pay back their worthless student loans. They're not buying new cars, they're not buying homes -- they're **not ""middle-class"" consumers**, they're living **dirt poor** with ""college educations"" which have little value.

And the banksters bought our politicians who rigged laws so the debt peonage students *cannot* discharge their massive debt with bankruptcy. And the banksters laugh all the way to their banks.

That's the **real history** of the current system. How do you propose to fix it?

&gt;  Why are they now being penalized once again for not going to college?

The people who did not go into college and who did not take out loans **are not being penalized** in any way!

That's you wrapping them in the clothes of ""victimhood"" and whining they're not living off from the gov't and being bailed out.

Traitor Trump promised to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it but despite having a Republican gov't for 2 solid years even the Republican House and Senate refused his nutty idea.

So traitor Trump resorted to brutalizing immigrant children, human rights abuses, and abusing his power by declaring a bogus ""national emergency"" to redirect Pentagon money to waste building a wall that doesn't work.

Let's see what [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-coronavirus-rally-remark/) has to say about what our impeached clown president said:

&gt; Did President Trump Refer to the Coronavirus as a ‘Hoax’?  

&gt; During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax.""

Sometimes it's to push conspiracy theories and lies, sometimes just to brag, and other times to rewrite and spin things.

Traitor Trump first uttered the ""it's their new hoax"" line on Feb. 28th in SC.

Rather than rely on tweets in which Trump spins things, you can [watch the video of the traitor first uttering his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Donald+Trump+Feb.+28+in+South+Carolina+hoax) and saying the phrase.

&gt; Also I think dems were still trying to impeach him during this...

Unfortunately the spineless Democrats are not!

Pelosi and the House should immediately put through a **second bill** to impeach Trump, only in this one to list out his many acts of corruption, abuses of power, violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause, and Trump's gross incompetence both generally and in leaving the country unprepared for a long-predicted pandemic.

Additionally Trump's many lies and the way they have mislead people and contributed to the 140K+ dead Americans killed by the virus should be listed in an impeachment bill.

But instead, the corrupt Democrats are working with Trump to funnel more money to the rich and their corporations.

It's worth noting that Obama gave a certain date that US troops first illegally were sent into Syria (I forget the exact year), and Trump, as president, gave *a different date* a full 2 years earlier that US troops went into Syria. (Who knows if Trump was telling the truth.)

It's also worth noting that in 2007/8 Candidate Obama campaigned on a platform of no more illegal wars and that a president had to go to congress to get authorization to attack another country -- simple common-sense, and a requirement of the US Constitution.

When the US/west started accusing Syria of using chemical attacks (suspiciously at a time when Syria was making huge gains in their war and knew the one thing that would bring about int'l condemnation was chemical weapons!), Obama stuck to his campaign platform and said that Congress would have to authorize strikes on Syria.

The only problem was that with the US losing in Afghanistan and having *lost* the war in Iraq, the US Congress was in no mood for another expensive war -- let alone one based on iffy ""WMD/chemical weapons"" claims.

So what did our ""constitutional law professor"" president do?

When Obama inserted US troops into Syria he did it **illegally** without an congressional authorization!

&gt; Trump will be re-elected

* threatened to attack 52 targets inside Iran if they dared launch a counter-attack to a Trump-initiated act of war, and then Trump cowardly backed down when Iran bombarded US bases injuring 100+ US soldiers (Trump just lied claiming 0 casualties!),

* belittled US troops he had injured in battle mocking them as malingerers saying they just had ""headaches"" as they were medivaced across the world (!) for their combat injuries,

* the clown who [disbanded the Pandemic Response Team in 2018 saying that as a businessman he did not believe in paying people to sit around waiting for something bad to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX7HWy9rFrc) -- thus leaving the US completely unprepared for the long-predicted virus

* Trump now leaves office under a rape lawsuit, with the IRS auditing his taxes, with huge amounts of corruption in gov't (drain the swamp my ass!) and with roughly 1/4 million dead Americans all due to Trump's incompetence and inability to govern.

Sleepy Joe Biden is certainly no prize to be proud of, but it's hard to imagine him doing a *worse* job than traitor Trump.

&gt; To a greater extent than many others, the first-past-the-post method encourages ""tactical voting"". Voters have an incentive to vote for a candidate who they predict is more likely to win, in preference to their preferred candidate who may be unlikely to win and for whom a vote could be considered as wasted.

&gt; **The position is sometimes summarised, in an extreme form, as ""all votes for anyone other than the runner-up are votes for the winner.""** This is because votes for these other candidates deny potential support from the second-placed candidate, who might otherwise have won. Following the extremely close 2000 U.S. presidential election, some supporters of Democratic candidate Al Gore believed one reason he lost to Republican George W. Bush is because a portion of the electorate (2.7%) voted for Ralph Nader of the Green Party, and exit polls indicated that more of them would have preferred Gore (45%) to Bush (27%).[16] This election was ultimately determined by the results from Florida, where Bush prevailed over Gore by a margin of only 537 votes (0.009%), which was far exceeded by the 97488 (1.635%) votes cast for Nader in that state.

Voters in states like Texas or California (and other high-population states) are *illegally* discriminated against in violation of the 14th Amendment -- all to favor people in small-population states like Vermont or Wyoming.

In this short century the disgraceful Electoral College has ""vetoed"" the votes of ""we the people"" and saddled us with 2 presidents against the wishes of the American people.

* George W. Bush went on to become a flat-out war criminal who deliberately lied to the American people and to the world. Bush became the **first and only** US president to violate signed-and-ratified treaties and US law to order our criminal military to use torture -- the first since George Washington forbade the US military from using torture.

* Donald Trump went on to become a literal *traitor to the US* calling on foreign countries to interfere in US politics and investigate his chief political rival. Trump was impeached for that treason, and then went on to play ""politics"" with a virus and has killed way over 100,000 Americans due to his sheer incompetence.

&gt; When President Donald Trump was challenged by Axios national political correspondent Jonathan Swan to respond to the fact that, ""a thousand Americans are dying a day"" due to COVID-19, the president responded as though the grim tally was perfectly acceptable, saying, ""They are dying, that's true. And it is what it is."" While observers were aghast at the callousness of his statement, it should not have surprised us. Trump had warned that the death toll would be high, and he had asked us months ago to get used to the idea. In late March, the White House Coronavirus Task Force had projected that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans would die from the virus. Rather than unveil an aggressive plan to tackle the spread and prevent the projected mortality figures, the president had said, ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead.""

27138,2020-08-19 00:23:51,[Commentary] Obama Is Wrong About the Filibuster,,2020-08-19 00:34:24,AmericanPolitics,t3_icd8c3,"From the article --

' When former President Barack Obama eulogized Rep. John Lewis, he made an impassioned plea for a litany of voting rights measures, such as enacting automatic voter registration, ending partisan gerrymandering, and establishing statehood for Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. And he added, “If all this takes eliminating the filibuster — another Jim Crow relic — in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that’s what we should do.”

' These proposals are meant to strengthen our democracy, but to achieve them by eliminating the legislative filibuster would destroy it.

' Obama’s logic is reasonable and supported by many frustrated Democrats: The right to vote is fundamental tenet of our democracy, and it is untenable to allow one party to deny anyone that right. Fully enfranchising all Americans is more important than maximizing the power of the Senate minority through a musty procedural tool.

' ...

' ... You think partisan gerrymandering is bad? Just wait until Republicans start carving up states to even the score after the partisan admission of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico to the union.

' Such an arms race in the weaponization of rules is literally how democracies bring about their own demise ...

' Obama portrays the filibuster as inherently illegitimate by deeming it a “Jim Crow relic.” But the filibuster was not created in the Jim Crow era, nor was it ever the sole province of white supremacists. [The filibuster was codified in 1790.] 

' A Brookings Institution account places the first filibuster in 1837.... A Stanford Law Review paper says the first was in 1841....

' Even when racist senators eagerly wielded the filibuster during the Jim Crow era, so did other factions. ..

' ... the filibuster was not created by racists for racist purposes. It has been used for racist purposes, but also for legitimate ones.

' Still, the filibuster is not in the Constitution. It wasn’t codified in the original Senate rules. If the filibuster was not created by the Founders, and is not inherent to our system of government, doesn’t that argue we should have no qualms about ditching it?

' What the Founders did create is a republican system of government designed to avoid, in the words of John Adams, a “tyranny of the majority.” To turn the Senate into a strictly majoritarian body would undermine that intent.

' ...

' Getting rid of the filibuster won’t help Democrats solve problems if their solutions don’t stay on the books. And our entire government will lack stability if no one can be sure if laws and programs will carry over from one Congress to the next.

' Abuse of the filibuster, paralyzing our government, should not be tolerated. But in that circumstance, the challenge for Democrats is to pursue policies that galvanize the public, so the filibusterers pay a political price and lack incentive for further gridlock. Sometimes, when you fight fire with fire, you burn the whole house down. '",1,[],[],['Barack Obama']

Sure he is. Obama was to replace a SC justice 9 months before the election and the Republicans said the principle was that no president could do that in an election year. One of the instances they cited was Abraham Lincoln refusing to appoint a justice until after the election.

But now, only 1 month before the election the party proves they're hypocrites with no political principles, they sh\*t on Lincoln's legacy, and they pack the court with this anti-abortion nut case and Trump openly says he wants her to rig the election for him.

That's what I hope Biden does. He can do simple math about the number of cases involved and use that rationale to expand the court to 11 or 13. I'm hoping for the latter number. And I hope Biden packs the court with far-left nominees that are in their 30s, leftist judges that make RBG look like a conservative.

&gt;– Nearly $100,000 spent on copies of Donald Trump Jr.’s book Triggered, which helped propel it to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list.

&gt;**– Over $7.4m spent at Trump-branded properties since 2017.**

&gt;– At least $35.2m spent on Trump merchandise.

&gt;– $38.7m in legal and “compliance” fees. In addition to tapping the RNC and his campaign to pay legal costs during his impeachment proceedings, Mr Trump has also relied on his political operation to cover legal costs for some aides.

&gt;– At least $14.1m spent on the Republican National Convention. The event was supposed to have been held in Charlotte, North Carolina, but Mr Trump relocated it to Jacksonville, Florida, after a dispute with North Carolina's Democratic governor over coronavirus safety measures. The Florida event was ultimately cancelled, as well, with a mostly online convention taking its place.

&gt;– $912,000 spent on ads that ran on the personal Facebook pages of Mr Parscale and Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson.

&gt;– A $250,000 ad run during Game 7 of the 2019 World Series, which came after Mr Trump was booed by spectators when he attended Game 5.

&gt;– At least $218,000 for Trump surrogates to travel aboard private jets provided by campaign donors.

29474,2020-11-04 23:04:28,"Lincoln Project 'Epically Failed,' Say Progressives as Trump Wins Bigger Share of Republican Voters Than in 2016 | ""Turns out there were no 'Biden Republicans.'""",,2020-11-05 03:01:27,AmericanPolitics,t3_jo73s3,"&gt;The share of Republican voters who supported Trump increased from 90% in 2016 to 93% in 2020 

This is a misreading of the polls, plain and simple. Kenny Stancil, David Sirota, Andrew Perez, Julia Rock, and Alex Vitale just doesn't understand how polls are conducted.

Pollsters select their samples at random, and then ask respondents to self-identify by party. People have a strong tendency to self-identify according to the party they intend to support in the upcoming election, rather than by their actual voter registration. This tendency is especially pronounced when it comes to polarizing figures like Donald Trump.

So the fact that a greater share of self-identified Republicans said that they support Trump doesn't mean that Biden failed to gain support among registered Republicans. It means that Republicans who didn't support Trump were more likely to distance themselves from their party's candidate.

Exit polling reveals that Trump lost ground in the overwhelmingly white Republican Party. White people were significantly less likely to support Trump this year, and so were men and older voters. The only reason Trump has been competitive at all has been an increase in support from Hispanic and African-American voters, and among voters aged 30-44. In other words, Trump lost ground with the Republican constituencies, and gained among the younger, browner voters who usually support Democrats.

So if we're going to judge The Lincoln Project by whether or not Trump lost ground with Republican voters, we'd have to give them an A+. Personally, I think they deserve high marks, but I think there were other factors and other organizations that also helped, including Biden himself. Also, we'd have to give a failing grade to the idiots at *Jacobin*, *The Root,* *The American Prospect*, *Common Dreams*, and *The Daily Poster*, because the evidence would suggest that some of the people they were speaking to drifted over to Trump's side.",0,[],[],['Donald Trump']

And we see the richest 1% now control ~40% of our country's wealth -- the gap between the rich and poor has never been higher.

* Trump now leaves office under a rape lawsuit, with the IRS auditing his taxes, with huge amounts of corruption in gov't (drain the swamp my ass!) and with roughly 1/4 million dead Americans all due to Trump's incompetence and inability to govern.

Sleepy Joe Biden is certainly no prize to be proud of, but it's hard to imagine him doing a *worse* job than traitor Trump.

Chad Fredrick Wolf (born 1976) is an American government official who was unlawfully named acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security in November 2019.Previously, he was Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans. On August 25, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Wolf to be confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Homeland Security, after the Trump administration disputed GAO claims that Wolf had illegally served as Acting DHS Secretary since November 2019. In November 2020, a federal judge ruled that Wolf was unlawfully appointed acting secretary and overturned a set of Wolf's orders as ""not an exercise of legal authority"".A member of the Republican Party, Wolf previously served in several positions in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including as Chief of Staff of the Transportation Security Administration and chief of staff to DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He was an architect of the Trump administration family separation policy in 2018, and prominently involved in the deployment of federal law enforcement forces in Portland and elsewhere beginning in July 2020.

&gt; As the newspaper reported on Thursday, &amp;quot;Two separate New York State fraud investigations into President Trump and his businesses, one criminal and one civil, have expanded to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in consulting fees, some of which appear to have gone to Ivanka Trump, according to people with knowledge of the matter.""

&gt; Beyond these cases, there are numerous acts Trump committed as president, such as his business deals with the Saudi government, that haven&amp;#039;t been sufficiently investigated because Trump was able to stonewall congressional oversight.

&gt; There are serious political reasons for a Biden Department of Justice to refrain from prosecuting Trump.

*****
&gt; WASHINGTON - According to a new poll from Gallup, President-elect Joe Biden&amp;#039;s favorability rating is up following the conclusion of the election while President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s has dipped.

&gt; These findings are historically consistent, as Biden&amp;#039;s current favorability fits the trend of the person winning the election having a high approval rating immediately afterwards.

&gt; Trump has yet to concede and continues to make baseless claims of voter fraud while still pushing election lawsuit battles across the country, but acknowledged for the first time last week he would leave the White House if the Electoral College votes - as it will - to make Biden the next president.

There are law suits in PA stating that the way the mail in ballots were allowed is unconstitutional, which was the case across the country.

For Putin, taking Trump in would be an incredibly huge psyop and PR win. It would be played on Russian media and propaganda overseas like this:

&gt;Putin gave safe protection to an embattled US president, outed by a corrupt US government and a tainted election. Now safely inside Moscow, Donald Trump is free to tell the world all the ""US secrets"" he wants on Russia Today, and we have him live for an interview at 6 PM tonight.

Not to mention, Trump can continue to invoke dissent and division in the US through Russian media, which of course, the US media will pick up. 

I could be entirely wrong, and Putin could definitely turn him away as you both claimed earlier. He may have outlived his usefulness and is just dead weight after January 20th.

&gt;The President is spending day after day in his White House bunker, entertaining crackpot theories about imposing martial law, seizing voting machines and staging an intervention in Congress on January 6 to steal the election from Biden.

.

&gt;On Monday, he huddled with a cabal of Republican lawmakers who plan to challenge the election on baseless claims of fraud at a special session of Congress to ratify the results on January 6.

.

&gt;His attempts to crush American democratic traditions by claiming a landslide victory in an election that he lost and that was not especially close fits into the first category. The President's behavior has sown huge mistrust of the fundamental underpinning of the US political system -- fair elections -- among millions of his voters and threatens to compromise the legitimacy of Biden's White House.

.

&gt;Trump's indifference to multiple crises stirred by his rule make up the second category of his political vandalism. This includes his apathy about a raging pandemic that has infected 18 million Americans and killed nearly 320,000 as an aching nation marks its darkest holiday season in generations.

.

&gt;Trump is also running interference for Russia, prioritizing the interests of an adversary over America's after a massive cyberattack blamed on the Kremlin.

&gt;These infractions add up to the dereliction of presidential duty on a grand scale. It is impossible to imagine any other president of the modern era behaving in such a way or for either of the political parties to tolerate his abuse of power. Former President George W. Bush's neglect during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 seems tame by comparison.

.

&gt;The madcap schemes of some of Trump's acolytes -- such as retired Gen. Michael Flynn's mooted plan to send troops to battleground states to redo elections that the President lost -- have no chance of playing out. Even if Trump's renegades had the competence to mount such a threat, the courts have shown zero tolerance for the President's autocratic attempts to destroy US democracy. It is unthinkable the military would deploy to reverse a popular vote on US soil.

.

&gt;**Trump's loss of composure is grave enough from a domestic point of view. But it sends a signal to US adversaries of a vacuum of leadership. His bizarre refusal to endorse his government's assessment that Russia is behind the cyberattack suggests there is a 30-day window of impunity for enemies dedicated to tarnishing US national interests. The thought of an agitated, emotional President faced with any sudden foreign policy crisis is not a reassuring one.**

.

&gt;The effort will not succeed in invalidating Biden's election since Democrats control the House of Representatives and there is no sign that a majority of Republicans in the Senate -- most of whom are now acknowledging that Biden is President-elect -- will play along. **But the pro-Trump lawmakers can stage a stunt that would make a mockery of democracy and further sow distrust of America's political system among the President's fervent supporters -- a scenario that could cause years of damage.**

Should I keep going?

Our incompetent braggart president disbanded the Pandemic Response Team in 2018 justifying it by saying he was a businessman and didn't believe in paying people to stand around waiting for something bad to happen.

Trump left the country wide-open for the virus! He closed down *some* people coming into the US from China, but big deal -- the virus was already in the US and spreading like wildfire. Trump refused to follow the CDC's pandemic playbook which focused on massive early testing.

Trump did not act to ramp up PPE production. Trump rejected the WHO COVID-19 test and insisted on a botched MAGA American-made test that was a huge delay.

And our clown president lied and spun the virus -- telling flat-out lie after flat-out lie, for month after month!

Remember how the virus was the Democrats' hoax? Or how back in March the impeached liar claimed that everyone could get a test who wanted a test?! Or his absurd, repeated statements about hydroxy... and how that was a miracle drug?

Incompetent Nancy Pelosi should have drawn up a *second* article of impeachment for lying and leaving the country defenseless.

And now we're the laughingstock of the world -- hundreds of thousands of dead Americans, hospital systems swamped turning sick people away, etc. -- all because the reality TV star got into the White House after losing the 2016 election by ~3 million votes to corrupt but half-competent Hillary Clinton.

Traitor Trump murdering the Iranian general just painted US drone murders in a more negative light. It gives Iran a *legitimate reason* to strike back at the US.

And Trump's murderous act of war caused 2 democratic Iraqi gov'ts to demand US troops leave their country -- further undermining US imperialism and highlighting the fact that we *lost* the Iraq war. All of the goals the torturing war criminal George W. Bush set out for Iraq have not been achieved, a complete US loss.

Trump's withdrawing from the JCPOA Iranian nuclear agreement Obama created isolates the US. Iran is free and legal to enrich uranium to 30-40% to create medical types of enriched uranium. And Iran continues to follow the UN and its facilities are monitored by the IAEA and int'l observers 24/7.

All of the restrictions Obama got Iran to agree to Trump destroyed -- and Trump got *nothing* in return.

It's almost comical to see the Nat'l Review smear Iran as ""the theocracy"" -- while completely ignoring the *fact* that the US supports and arms literal theocracies in Saudi Arabia and in apartheid Israel.

&gt; On Dec. 12, a poster on the website MyMilitia.com urged violence if senators made official the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.

&gt; “If this does not change, then I advocate, Revolution and adherence to the rules of war,” wrote someone identifying themselves as I3DI. “I say, take the hill or die trying.”

&gt; Wrote another person: “It’s already apparent that literally millions of Americans are on the verge of activating their Second Amendment duty to defeat tyranny and save the republic.”

&gt; “On TheDonald, more than 50% of the top posts on January 4, 2021, about the January 6th Electoral College certification featured unmoderated calls for violence in the top five responses,” the organization found.

&gt; “ARMED WITH RIFLE, HANDGUN, 2 KNIVES AND AS MUCH AMMO AS YOU CAN CARRY,” one post on the website said.

&gt; This was also the case on Parler, ADI found. One account, with the name No Trump No Peace #GoTime, posted a GIF with a noose and a caption that said, “Who would you like to see 'dispatched' first? 1) Nancy Pelosi 2) John Roberts 3) Pence 4) other (please name) I was leaning towards Nancy, but it might have to be Pence.” (Two days after that post, a livestream of the violent mob standing outside Congress showed them chanting “Hang Mike Pence.”)",1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

Mark Milley to discuss options for preventing Trump from starting a war or launching a nuclear weapon.

&gt;“The situation of this unhinged president could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,” Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues revealing details of the call.

**Immediately** 

&gt;“Given the immense power of the office of president of the United States, including command of the world’s most powerful military, Trump’s capacity to do even greater damage to the United States and the world still remains within his reach,” retired Gen. John Allen, who led U.S. forces in Afghanistan, wrote in an op-ed for Foreign Policy. “After the events of Jan. 6, he must be immediately separated from the authorities vested in him as the nation’s commander in chief.”

**It's been done before**

&gt;In the final days of Nixon’s presidency, then-Defense Secretary James Schlesinger ordered military commanders to check with him or Secretary of State Henry Kissinger before executing a nuclear launch order, Schlesinger revealed years after the fact.

&gt;“Donald Trump is detached from reality, angry and acting out,” Lieu, Carbajal and Panetta wrote. “To safeguard our country from potential catastrophe, similar steps to those taken in August 1974 need to be taken now.”

Trump, of course, is far more detached from reality and self-absorbed than Nixon ever was.

He has no choice -- Snowden was *stranded* in Russia when Obama revoked his passport.

When the whistleblower ratted out the US gov't for the many crimes it was committing against the American people, Snowden skillfully routed his travel across the world to go to Ecuador where he was to get political asylum. Each stop on Snowden's itinerary was planned to be in countries where the US could not seize him.

When he was in the air Obama revoked his passport. When Snowden touched down in Moscow to change planes he could not board his next plane because he did not have a valid passport -- a diabolical calculation done by the Obama administration.

Putin did not want the headache of an American whistleblower in Russia, especially one that would not give up his many secrets to Russian intelligence. But reluctantly, Russia gave him political asylum.

And ever since then, propagandists in the US have falsely portrayed the *American hero* Snowden as some sort of Russian tool.

His coronavirus management has resulted in more than 24.1 million cases in the United States and almost 400,000 deaths — projected to exceed 500,000 deaths by May. While overseeing arguably the worst loss of life since the great influenza of 1918, Trump also presided over the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. He is the first president in modern history to see a net loss of jobs during his time in office.

&gt;Those bare figures — catastrophic as they are — barely begin to plumb the depths of Trump’s failures, which were **moral** as much as managerial.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was the most **dishonest** president ever: He produced more than 30,000 documented falsehoods.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was the most **corrupt** president ever. He used his office to enrich his businesses, interfered in Justice Department investigations, engaged in obstruction of justice, stonewalled Congress, refused to release his tax returns, purged inspectors-general and pardoned his cronies and co-conspirators.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was the most openly **racist** president in modern times — arguably since Woodrow Wilson. He consistently tried to fire up his White base with bigotry against people of color. His actions too often matched his vile words — most notoriously when he ordered the children of undocumented immigrants separated from their parents.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was the first president who **refused to accept election defeat** or propagated bizarre **conspiracy theories** to undermine confidence in the electoral system.  
&gt;  
&gt;He became the only president ever **impeached twice** — once for trying to **blackmail** Ukraine into helping him politically, the second time for **inciting a violent insurrection** to try to stay in office.  
&gt;  
&gt;He leaves office with **only 34 percent approval** in the Gallup poll after having been the first president never to crack 50 percent support since the advent of Gallup polling.

You see? So that anytime you’re head of an empire, no matter what color, no matter what — either Democrat or Republican, you’re head of an empire, you’re going to be tied to crimes against humanity.

&gt; And I refuse to normalize that. You know, I refuse to just look at Bill Clinton and say nothing about a vicious, vicious crime bill and a withdrawal of resources for people who are hungry. You see, just morally and spiritually, that is — that’s wrong. And Obama dropping these drones and bailing out Wall Street rather than working people, and killing, assassinating American citizens with no no due process at all, and he walks around like he’s some grand progressive. Please, get off the crack pipe. We’ve got to tell the truth. The truth is bigger than all of us. Bush, we won’t even get into, in terms of the Iraq War and so on, and the lies and so forth.

&gt; This is what we don’t hear on corporate media. Thank God for Democracy Now! That God for what you all do, because we can’t normalize this kind of mistreatment of our fellow human beings.

Many think a doctor goes in with salad tongs, grabs the baby by its head, pulls it out and tosses it in a trash can.

NO!

When a woman misses her period by days or even a week or so, she takes a pregnancy test.  

Depending on the results, her and the man are happy or sad, depending on their current situation in life and whether or not they are planning a family at that time.  

If they decide that the timing of a pregnancy is not what they desire, they can *legally* choose to not continue the pregnancy and wait to start a family..

Now here is where most people are misinformed.  Within the first several weeks of pregnancy, an abortion means a woman takes a pill and it is followed by a heavier period.  

No fetus, arms, legs, head, heartbeat, soul, just a heavier period blood flow.  

*That is the overwhelming majority of abortions!* 

*A heavier period!*

After a couple months an abortion is mostly decided on medical issues - either the mother or the fetus or both are at risk.  

At that point, parents have decided to raise and love the baby, have picked out a name and perhaps even painted the baby's room pink or blue and started buying a crib, toys, diapers, etc.

A second or third term abortion is a heart wrenching decision, not that they months later one day decide ""I changed my mind about having a baby"".   

Later term abortions take a toll on the parents, the doctor and any family members/friends who were looking forward to spoiling and raising a child.

The overwhelming majority of abortions occur very early, with a heavy period blood flow, *that is all, not the murder of an infant.*

Politics and religion should not play a role in these medical facts and a mother's choice...",2,['Joe Biden'],[],[]

&gt;[The mob that stormed the Capitol was extremely well-organized.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/podcasts/the-daily/capitol-mob-police-social-media.html?showTranscript=1) The day after the election, a group immediately pops up on Facebook called Stop the Steal. They are immediately popular in really just an unprecedented way. They’re gaining 100 new members every 10 seconds. In its short life of 48 hours, it had managed to attract 320,000 people. But more importantly, it spawned hundreds of other Stop the Steal groups on Facebook and on Twitter. And now they’ve got Reddit boards. They start to splinter off into the farthest corners of the web. And they find themselves on these new social media platforms, like Gab and Parler. And we start to see leaders emerge. ""with Stop the Steal. We are the official originators of the January 6 event."" 

&gt;Those exact words, “occupy the Capitol,” were used well over 100 times that I could count in the two days leading up to them coming to Washington Wednesday. There was open talk by one of the organizers of what streets they could converge on that were closest to the Capitol building.

 North Dakota House passes 'Second Amendment sanctuary bill'
North Dakota's District 36 Rep. Luke Simons, of Dickinson, discusses House Bill 1272 that would apply to firearms, firearm accessories and ammunition manufactured in North Dakota that remain within the state's borders.
Written By: Jackie Jahfetson | Feb 18th 2021 - 3pm.

The North Dakota House of Representatives approved a bill that exempts firearms and accompanying accessories from federal mandates, laws and regulations if those products remain within the state. (James B. Miller, Jr./The Dickinson Press)

The North Dakota House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation that would exempt firearms and accompanying accessories from federal mandates, laws and regulations if those products remain within the state. The legislation is being coined as the “North Dakota gun sanctuary state bill.”

The lower chamber voted 69-23 Wednesday, Feb. 17, in favor of House Bill 1272. The bill will be forwarded to the Senate and if passed, sent to Gov. Doug Burgum's desk for signature.

Introduced by North Dakota’s District 36 Rep. Luke Simons, of Dickinson, the bill applies to firearms, firearm accessories and ammunition manufactured in North Dakota that remain within the state's borders — thusly allowing federally restricted access to bump stocks and high capacity magazines.

Proponents of the bill say that the need for protecting already enshrined rights under the Second Amendment are needed considering the current administration in Washington and a long history of attacks on the Second Amendment. Opponents of the bill stated that the bill could allow residents to legally manufacture unregulated guns or accessories using 3-D printers, including those which have been banned by federal mandates.

Simons said the bill would amend North Dakota Century Code, specifically areas relating to manufactured firearms, accessories and ammunition.

“... The truth is that in the Second Amendment you have the right to bear arms and the reason you have that right is to defend against foreign and domestic terrorists,” Simons said. “The reason you have the right to bear arms is to protect all the rest of your rights, including the right to make weapons. The constitution says, ‘shall not be infringed.’ So it is a God-given right for you to make a weapon.”

Simons said this bill is pertinent following Democratic President Joe Biden’s campaign, which heavily pushed for the cease of manufacturing and sale of assault rifles and accessories. However, North Dakota laws and regulations wouldn't be by the wayside under HB1272, he added.

“You can make anything you want except for things that are already illegal in North Dakota, like a fully automatic machine gun. So this can't break North Dakota laws, and is only not subjected to federal guidelines,” Simons remarked. “The commerce clause, which is very important, means you cannot cross state lines with the guns, accessories or ammunition... At that point it would be illegal. Eight other states have already done this, nine actually but it wasn't upheld. So this is very close to the gun freedom act that these other states have already administered.”

Across the nation, states have created sanctuary policies to exempt themselves from federal legislation in areas where state legislators feel the federal government has overstepped its purview, such as Colorado and Washington, which announced that they wouldn’t enforce federal drug laws relating to marijuana. Other examples include California, who stated that they will not enforce certain federal immigration mandates within their state. Should the Senate move forward with this bill, Simons noted that it would make North Dakota a ""Second Amendment sanctuary state.""

“This administration in Washington is coming after your guns folks. It truly is. We have to stand up and stand strong. Call your legislators and tell them to vote yes on HB1272,” Simons added.

The bill is now on its way to the Senate where it is expected to garner much deliberation and debate as more left-leaning legislators ""tote party lines,"" with Simons noting that there will be “some resistance.”

“... Our founding fathers had courage to stand up against the greatest empire of the known world and we need to do the same in today's assembly because so many legislators are scared to stand up against the federal government. It is our job, we are literally the sheriff's of the federal government. I took an oath and swore to uphold this constitution and by God, that is what I'm going to do,” Simons said, adding, “Our federal government cannot break the constitution, they are not exempt. In fact, they are chained by it. Only if we as a state keep them in chains… which we refuse to do it seems these days.""",2,[],[],['Joe Biden']

Quite true. That's why he was installed in the White House. Trump ruled not with a ""mandate"" from the people, but by the power of the gov't.

&gt; Who gives a fuck what mainstream public opinion polls show?

It shows that the American people disapproved of traitor Trump as president. He had no ""mandate"" -- he was an anomaly that our outdated Constitution saddled us with.

&gt; His son belongs in prison. He does too.

Well, then traitor Trump should have had the Justice Dept. indict the Bidens -- so why didn't they?! Based on my reading, the DOJ didn't indict the Bidens because there was not enough evidence.

I've got no problem investigating the Bidens. I'm saddened that traitor Trump did not fulfill his promise to lock up Hillary Clinton -- clearly she was guilty of crimes.

But blowhard Trump is just as much of a BS artist as any other politician that we have. The Democrat and Republican parties are full of such plutocrats.

&gt;  a course that seems likely to put Trump back in the White House.

Trump only got into the White House the first time because of fluke -- a minority president rejected by a plurality of voters.

Now traitor Trump is old, more senile and is disgrace. He's a known con-man. There's no way he'll be back in 2024 and I hope justice does its job and he's locked up in a cage for the crimes he's committed.

&gt; “The 15 [cases in the US] within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero. We're going very substantially down, not up."" -- US president Donald Trump lying and downplaying the Covid-19 virus, 26 Feb. 2020.",3,[],[],['Donald Trump']

Top racketeering attorney tapped for election probe,,2021-03-09 17:57:24,AmericanPolitics,t3_m0yl04,"&gt; Which is the literal definition of being anti-democratic. The majority should decide who is their leader, not the minority who live in empty states that do nothing but take tax dollars from the majority states and make corn off subsidies given to them by those majority states.

When our nation was formed by a union of sovereign states some compromises were made.  How we elect Presidents reflects those compromises.  If we are going to undo those compromises then states will no longer want to be part of the union.  Sounds good to me.

&gt; You're right. It just shows what the opinion of leadership is. And that was constantly in the negative. For four years.

Nah, it shows you what powerful people and the pollsters they own want you to see.

&gt; Oh no! Why go after Trump when we can try to play the ""both sides are the same"" game?!

Trump is an amateur in political corruption when compared to our politicians like Biden who have a lifetime of practice.  There aren’t two sides.  There’s a bipartisan agreement that they will enrich themselves and nobody will ever be held accountable.  Are you even paying attention?

&gt; Maybe if we start holding someone accountable, that will make them all accountable. Or is that too progressive for you?

There is no interest in ending the corrupt crony capitalism that enriches our politicians.  Get serious.

&gt; Reminder: Al Franken was cast out of the Senate in weeks,

Franken was smart to get out of a hopelessly corrupt system.  He’s evidence of how misguided that #metoo bullshit is.  Despite more credible accusations against Biden he was elected President.  So much for the #metoo bullshit...
 
&gt; Roy Moore was voted in by millions even after it came out he was a pedophile. Those millions? Republicans.

I think hebephile is more accurate.  But he can’t hold a candle to Bill Clinton and his time on the Lolita Express.  It’s disturbing that a former President was so tight with a guy running a honeypot to get dirt on powerful Americans for Israel.  What do you think they made Clinton do?

&gt; There LITERALLY were causalities. They happened at the Capitol itself, and they were police officers.

The only deliberate killing I’ve seen is of an unarmed woman by a police officer.  That shooting was egregious but the cop won’t be held accountable.  So much for protesting police brutality...

&gt; The only reason there weren't more is because members of Congress, like AOC, were barricaded, hiding, and guarded by other members of Congress on top of the police guarding the halls. 

LOL.  AOC was crying in a building across the street.  What’s fucking coward.  It’s telling that none of our “representatives” had the courage to engage with the angry people they purport to represent.  Some leaders.

&gt; What exactly does his son belong in prison for? Do you have financial records, or any evidence whatsoever? Please, provide a legal and logical argument and I will back it.

I’m sure the Chinese got plenty on him when he visited China as a bag man for his dad.  He peddled influence with our government and raked in millions.  Those involved belong in prison.  It’s not fucking complicated.  But that’s the fuel on which our crony capitalist society runs...

&gt; Oh, never mind. You're a full on cultist. Got it.

Why are we even debating this?

Trump is a literal traitor to the US, having called on multiple foreign gov'ts to interfere in US elections which resulted in his 1st impeachment. (MAGA my ass!)

Trump knew he'd lose the 2020 election worse than he lost the 2016 election, so he laid the groundwork saying the 2020 election was rigged weeks before votes were even cast.

Trump attacked the MI governor when fascists planned to kidnap her and he told his Proud Boyz to stand down and stand by.

Then on Jan. 6 he ordered the white mob of fascists to march on the US Capitol and to stop the election certification and traitor Trump gleefully watched from the White House on TV and Ivanka tweeted that the people attacking the Capitol were ""patriots.""

The only thing we should be talking about regarding Donald Trump is a demand for his prosecution for his many crimes.

What witch hunt? It seems pretty clear the Bidens were neck-deep in corruption in Ukraine.

&gt; Meanwhile trump and his children are fucking monstrous criminals.

True. We should prosecute the entire bunch. But instead, Republicans and Democrats have this rule that high political figures -- and the rich in general -- are never prosecuted.

The Podesta e-mails clearly showed campaign crimes committed by the 2016 Clinton campaign. Traitor Trump lead chants of crowds saying ""lock her up"" -- which we should have! But in 4 years Trump did nothing.

Similarly, 2016's Trump campaign was as crooked as sin. He literally paid off whores to hide his crimes from the American people. We had 4 solid years of corruption and emolument violations. But incompetent Nancy Pelosi never brought up 1 charge in **2** impeachments. Even after traitor Trump attempted a violent coup we have no federal charges.

How can *anyone* have respect for such a gov't and these 2 corrupt ruling parties?

That's what the political rehabilitation is all about. Give it some time and Hunter will be heralded as a poster boy of virtue, how a young man can be lead off the path by drugs and now once ""corrected"" by intervention and a loving family, is a political superstar.

Mark my words, the next we'll hear about him is mayor of Wilmington or congressman or some such stepping-stone political office. That's how corruption and family connections work.

Before he became TX governor and then president and torturing war criminal, George W. Bush was the poster boy of a silver spoon child -- spared the horrors of Vietnam by being placed into a ""champagne unit"" of the Nat'l Guard to keep him out of harm's way (a unit he *deserted* from!). Then the political rehabilitation kicked in.

As TX governor Bush was mocked as a city slicker who liked to hang out in TX ""gentlemen clubs"" drinking expensive whiskey while sitting in padded leather chairs. But in office as president his media handlers reinvented him as a ""rancher"" -- political rehabilitation.

&gt; But his scandals implicate his father and others in his work to peddle influence in our government. 

Joe Biden *is* the gov't. He doesn't have to influence sh\*t -- he runs the damned gov't.

As far as what the Bidens did in Ukraine, that is standard operating procedure for how the US ""takes over"" a country.

In 2014 in Ukraine Obama put right-wingers and fascists into power by funding the violent overthrow of an elected gov't. Then the Bidens and many other Americans went in and started backing any Ukrainian oligarchs that we could buy or were willing to deal with Americans.

In the 1990s Time magazine ran a front-page story about how the US interfered in Russian elections to keep the drunken buffoon Boris Yeltsin in power.

The claims about Russia interfering in US elections are actually pretty weak. They come from untrustworthy US intelligence and shadowy ""cyber defense"" companies often paid for by the US gov't.

The fact that a British corporation, Cambridge Analytica, played a *major role* in the 2016 US election is ignored. Just like we ignore the documented Israeli interference in US election after election.

We target Russia because the US needs an enemy, we want a Cold War, and the US' desire is to balkanize and break up Russia.

If Russia is interfering in US elections then based on the *longstanding US precedent* don't they have that right? If countries are equal, then what we do they should be able to do. Again, we interfere in their elections, so why shouldn't they be able to interfere in ours?

&gt; Joe Biden will withdraw this smaller group of soldiers while leaving behind US Special Forces, mercenaries, and intelligence operatives - privatizing and downscaling the war, but not ending it.

&gt; On April 14, President Joe Biden announced that he would end the U.S.&amp;#039;s longest war and withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan on the 20th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks.

&gt; A blueprint for U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is the 1959-1975 secret war in Laos, where the CIA worked with hundreds of civilian contractors who flew spotter aircraft, ran ground bases, and operated radar stations in civilian clothes while raising its own private army among the Hmong to fight the pro-communist Pathet Lao.

100% true!! And it was the same low-bar idea for Obama!

Remember, Bush was caught 100% red-handed lying through his teeth making up BS claims about Saddam Hussein's WMD -- all so the oil-man Bush could control Iraq's massive oil wealth!

Bush launched needless wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere -- invented the whole global war on terror BS -- and **cut taxes at the same time!** Pure economic insanity.

Then Bush proceeded **to lose *all* of his wars!** Bush stooped so low he resorted to flat-out **torture** to try to hold onto Iraq -- but he couldn't do it! Think of the gravity of that. The US president was a flat-out, **undeniable** and literal ""torturing war criminal."" (And remember, the US ""free press"" and Democrats largely ignored Bush's war crimes and torture!)

By the time Bush left office the Taliban were in control of **more** of Afghanistan than they controlled in 2001, and Bush *had to* sign an agreement with Iraq forcing US troops to leave Iraq in 2011 (which is what Obama was forced to do). Bush single-handedly flushed decades and decades of faux-US-morality and good will garnered since WWII and flushed it down the crapper.

That's a pretty f\*cking low bar for the next president.

&gt; Trump, who was clearly the worst President in US history.

This former professor and history teacher disagrees! Trump was a literal traitor to the US -- impeached **twice**. And traitor Trump holds the unique disgraceful distinction of trying to launch a coup d'etat to overturn the results of an election.

But to me, Trump's damage was not systemic or long-term. Hell, in only 100 days Biden has un-done a lot of Trump's damage.

Bush, on the other hand, committed egregious crimes and our ""constitutional law professor"" president Obama let Bush off the hook scot-free refusing to prosecute him.

Hell, with the sole exception of torture, Obama blessed or refused to condemn *all* of Bush's nutty precedents -- everything from warrantless spying on the American people to endless undeclared wars to the misuse of ""signing statements"" to rewrite laws of Congress.

I have little good to say of **any** of our presidents in this sad century.

Then with the 2nd impeachment, the ignoramus showed she didn't learn a thing -- she again filed only 1 charge knowing that it would happen after Trump was out of office. Sheer, demonstrated incompetence, but the Democrats *still* kept her in charge!

What I was referring to was not the impeachment though.

Why aren't there federal charges filed against traitor Trump **right now**?

Incitement to riot, attempting to overthrow the gov't -- DC is all a federal jurisdiction -- why hasn't sleepy Joe Biden or ""prosecutor Harris"" and the DOJ filed federal charges against traitor Trump?

Why hasn't Pelosi bluntly and specifically asked some of the nutty GOP Reps if they consider Biden to be a legit president or not or if they think the election was ""stolen""? The Democrats are just useless and they're allowing fascism and the Big Lie to build up.

Again, raw spinelessness by the Democrats. How can anyone have an ounce of respect for such a party that cannot even be bothered to defend the Constitution?",1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

You mean pretty average summer gas prices in recent history? [Here's 2018 prices](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=39112): 

&gt;EIA’s expected average is down 3% from the **2018 summer average of $2.85/gal**, mainly because EIA expects crude oil prices will be lower than last summer. EIA publishes the Summer Fuels Outlook as a supplement to its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).

[Here's the average price of gas in the entire year of 2019](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42435):

&gt;U.S. regular retail gasoline prices averaged $2.60 per gallon (gal) in 2019, 11 cents/gal (4%) lower than in 2018. Gasoline prices rose steadily during the first quarter of the year, rising from $2.24 on January 7 **to $2.90/gal** on May 6, before gradually declining through the rest of the year.

&gt;The spike in housing? The HUGE increase in food prices? The high cost of energy? The instability of the continued wars?

FTFY. A historical recap: it's worth noting that without a doubt it is a fact that Gore got more votes from the American people than did Bush.

But in a lawsuit filed by Bush, the Supreme Court ordered a FL recount to be stopped which preserved a Bush victory in the undemocratic Electoral College. That SC decision was so warped and illogical that the court itself said in its own decision that it should never be used for future legal precedent again.

So Bush was put into the White House.

Bush would then create deliberate lies to create a case for war against the old US ally Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was armed and given money by Ronald Reagan. But Bush made up lies attacked our old ally Iraq so US oil companies could control Iraq's massive oil wealth -- a flat-out criminal war of aggression.

When patriotic Iraqis fought back against the invaders, war criminal president George Bush became the first president in US history to publicly order, acknowledge and support the use of **torture** to try to hold onto the US occupation of Iraq. We should never forget that the unelected-by-the-American-people president George W. Bush is a torturing war criminal.

Justice and right won out in the end and the US was forced to leave Iraq in an agreement signed by Bush but carried out by Obama.

No one refused to acknowledge any source of the virus. You don't even know the source yourself. Everyone is operating on the information that is available to them.

&gt;  
On Tuesday morning, the Arizona House Appropriations Committee stripped Secretary of State Katie Hobbs of her ability to defend election lawsuits. It gave the power exclusively to the Attorney General.

And why are they doing this? Because Hobbs has pointed out that the current ""audit"", which follows two real audits that found no wrongdoing, is a partisan fishing expedition. It's being conducted by a company that has never performed an audit before, whose CEO has a history of tweeting [lunatic conspiracy theories](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/experts-grifters-firm-runs-arizona-audit-77858708).

The legislature is taking this step because Hobbs wants an investigation into the ""audit"", and Attorney General Brnovich thinks that there is no need to investigate a no-bid state contract that was awarded to an out-of-state firm with no experience.

&gt;On Thursday, Arizona’s Secretary of State Katie Hobbs sent a letter claiming the election machines that were audited by the Cyber Ninja team these past few weeks should never be used again.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This equipment was accessed by amateur, uncertified ‘auditors’ with zero transparency. I support election integrity, and therefore can’t support the continued usage of these machines,” she wrote.

Of course, Hobbs was right to do that. No competent election official would use a voting machine after that machine had been outside state custody and potentially tampered with by an individual or organization with no certification.

&gt;Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward has had it with what she sees as the obstruction in the Maricopa County, Arizona election audit and now she is threatening action.  
  
“There have to be consequences,” she said during an appearance on One America News. “There could be arrests of people who are refusing to comply.”

We Arizonans know that Kelli Ward is a raving lunatic, and she proves it once again by threatening to arrest people who aren't going along with her ""audit"". Of course, Ward's position within the Republican Party does not give her the authority to have anyone arrested.

&gt;Her interview came on the same day that it was discovered that election data that was rumored to have been deleted was found.  
  
The information that was alleged to have been deleted has been recovered, an auditor said.

And what was the source of that false rumor? Oh yes, [it was the sham audit](https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-auditors-backtrack-no-election-231038931.html), and their lies were amplified by none other than Donald Trump.",12,[],[],['Donald Trump']

36771,2021-06-01 15:32:08,Biden budget bakes in billions for nuclear weapons | The administration is going full speed ahead on beefing up the triad and expensive modernization — despite cries from his own party.,,2021-06-01 21:06:40,AmericanPolitics,t3_npwpjw,"Remember, this is the US long-term strategy dutifully carried out by both Republicans and Democrats.

Despite making sweet-sounding speeches against nuclear weapons -- being a key part of his undeserved Nobel Peace Prize (Europe's way of rehabilitating the US' image after the torturous Bush presidency) -- behind the scenes Obama spent huge sums of money both designing a whole new generation of nuclear weapons, and also spending on the complete refurbishment of the US' nuclear MIC.

In addition, both Bush and Obama's Pentagon revamped the US' military doctrine making it ""easier"" for the US to use nukes.

That was such blatant hypocrisy that the mild-mannered, diplomatic-speaking SIPRI bluntly said:

&gt; ""The ambitious US modernization plan presented by the Obama Administration is in stark contrast to President Barack Obama’s pledge to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and the role they play in US national security strategy."" -- Analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, June 2016.

Trump carried on those policies. Now with all that done, Biden is spending the money to actually build the new nuclear weapons.

Critics have long said that the new nuclear warheads ability -- so called ""dial-a-nuke"" -- to change the nuclear yield from very small to large on the same warhead actually makes nuclear war more likely.

In eastern Europe the US does not have the ground forces to win any war against Russia. 2 different Pentagon wargames have shown that if China tries to re-take Taiwan and the US got involved the US would lose. Recent public statements by the US have bluntly said the US will use nukes in such cases.

https://www.newsweek.com/some-questions-kamala-harris-about-eligibility-opinion-1524483

Where the author of the essay explores the legal idea of there being a difference between ""natural born"" citizen, and a ""naturalized"" citizen in regards to holding high office? 

That didn't strike me as racist, but the right certainly loved to cherry pick from it when it came out apparently. 

Here's the editors note:
 ---------

Editor's note, 8/14: This op-ed is being used by some as a tool to perpetuate racism and xenophobia. We apologize. The essay, by John Eastman, was intended to explore a minority legal argument about the definition of who is a ""natural-born citizen"" in the United States. But to many readers, the essay inevitably conveyed the ugly message that Senator Kamala Harris, a woman of color and the child of immigrants, was somehow not truly American.

The op-ed was never intended to spark or to take part in the racist lie of Birtherism, the conspiracy theory aimed at delegitimizing Barack Obama, but we should have recognized the potential, even probability, that that could happen. Readers hold us accountable for all that we publish, as they should; we hold ourselves accountable, too. We entirely failed to anticipate the ways in which the essay would be interpreted, distorted and weaponized.

As we said in our earlier note, this essay was an attempt to examine a legal argument about the difference between ""natural born"" and ""naturalized,"" the latter being ineligible to hold the office of president. In the days since the op-ed was published, we saw that it was being shared in forums and social networks notorious for disinformation, conspiracy theories and racist hatred. All of us at Newsweek are horrified that this op-ed gave rise to a wave of vile Birtherism directed at Senator Harris. Many readers have demanded that we retract the essay, but we believe in being transparent and are therefore allowing it to remain online, with this note attached.

Containment is a geopolitical strategic foreign policy pursued by the United States. It is loosely related to the term cordon sanitaire which was later used to describe the geopolitical containment of the Soviet Union in the 1940s. The strategy of ""containment"" is best known as a Cold War foreign policy of the United States and its allies to prevent the spread of communism after the end of World War II. As a component of the Cold War, this policy caused a response from the Soviet Union to increase communist influence in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, while also being regarded as the beginning of the cold war.

Trump wanted to make peace in Korea -- that is completely unacceptable to the Pentagon, the intelligence apparatus and the deep state.

Trump said the truth about NATO. It should have been dissolved when the USSR broke up. But that is completely unacceptable to the Pentagon, the intelligence apparatus and the deep state.

Trump wanted to reinvent the American empire. But the Pentagon and many, many businesses have a keen interest in the US continuing its drive to take over the world.

It's defined in [the dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deep%20state) as:

&gt; an alleged secret network of especially nonelected government officials and sometimes private entities (as in the financial services and defense industries) operating extralegally to influence and enact government policy

In this case, I'm referring to the State Dept., Pentagon, intelligence agencies and MIC types who want to see the US continue its belligerent, aggressive and imperial foreign policies.

&gt; Trump never wanted peace in North Korea, 

Of course he did. He was hoping to win a Nobel Peace Prize for it. He threatened to wipe out NK with his ""big button"" of nuclear weapons, and then personally met with the NK dictator. Trump even walked across the border into NK, a country we are *officially at war with.*

In the last summit with Kim it was widely reported that the old Cold War militarist hawk Bolton put extreme pressure on Trump not to end the Korean War and to make peace.

The Pentagon and deep state was horrified at the prospect of peace in Korea. SK already trades *twice as much with China than SK trades with the US* and peace in Korea would mean ending the UN military command -- an unthinkable item for the Pentagon.

That UN military command gives a US general *full control* of the entire SK military. A SK officer's ultimate chain of command does not end with the SK president. Every member of the SK military's chain of command ends with the US general who is in charge of that UN military command. That's a little-known but powerful tool the US does not want to give up.

&gt; He just wanted a potential cockroach hotel

On January 13th, just one week prior to Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, more than 3000 people departed Honduras and El Salvador for the United States. That number grew to approximately 7000-8000 one week later.  
On January 16th, Guatemala and Mexico deployed the military to their borders, in an attempt to stop the migrant caravan from transiting through their countries on the way to the United States.

Nixon did all sorts of crimes but he attempted to merely rig an election. Trump knew he lost the election but he refused to admit defeat and instead executed his long-planned coup attempt.

The article's bare mention of the torturing war criminal George W. Bush is appalling.

* Have we forgotten that at the time of the 2004 Republican convention in NYC a Zogby Int'l poll found that fully 1/2 of NYers felt the US gov't was complicit in 9/11?

* Have we forgotten that Bush *needlessly* invaded Afghanistan -- that the Taliban offered to turn over Bin Laden both before and after 9/11?

* Have we forgotten that Bush made up deliberate, coldly-calculated lies to attack Iraq to steal/control its oil wealth -- lying to the American people and world?

* Have we forgotten that because Bush's war to control Iraq was unsuccessful that he inflicted the Iraqis with a sectarian civil war and then against both US domestic and int'l law became the first American president to publicly order torture?

* Have we forgotten all of the evil precedents Bush set -- endless wars, spying on American peace groups, recording Americans phone calls, murdering Americans overseas with drone strikes, the criminal claim that the US has a ""right"" to attack any country we want to, and on and on -- those evil precedents are still with us and have been blessed now by both Republicans and Democrats?

* And have we forgotten that Bush **lost all of the wars** he needlessly started? That his boasts and bogus theories about transforming the entire Middle East into democracies was just more hot air from a torturing war criminal?

The Atlantic should be ashamed of itself for the way they ignored Bush's crimes.

I don't care if Trump likes to wear orange make-up. I think the idea of men wearing make-up is something that I -- as a male -- don't want to see. But I understand Trump is a vain billionaire.

I think Trump wearing a wig/toupee is ridiculous -- but again, that's his choice. Dolly Parton wears a wig and I'm fine with Dolly.

What I do care about is that **Trump is a literal traitor**.

As someone who swore an oath to defend the US Constitution and spent 8 years in the US Army, someone whose ancestors rebelled against a British king, I take personal offense to Trump being a traitor.

Traitor Trump *repeatedly* called on foreign countries to interfere in US domestic politics -- at a time when Trump had the entire Dept. of Justice at his disposal to investigate the Bidens! I'm saddened that traitor Trump did not put Hillary Clinton on trial like the traitor promised he would.

And then on Jan. 6 traitor Trump ordered a mob of white fascists to march on my US Capitol and ""fight like hell"" to stop the certification of his election loss! He ought to be on trial and locked up in a cage for that.

But instead spineless Joe Biden does nothing about that treason and crimes.

What Biden is doing is what we expected him to do when people voted for him (I did not!).

Biden is a pro-corporate war hawk. So Biden is ramping up int'l tensions trying to start Cold Wars to distract people from our **many** domestic problems.

Biden talks about global warming, but just like he learned from 8 years under Obama, he actually does little but window dressing. Biden does not *eliminate* corporate welfare/subsidies to Big Oil, he just *reduces* them.

Rather than **lead** and propose bold initiatives, Biden talks trash. He's the typical Democrat president -- **not** a leader (the last Democrat to be a decent *leader* was JFK).

You know not of what you speak. RT is separate from Putin and the Kremlin, much like the BBC is from the queen and the British gov't.

One only has to see what American-born/raised/educated journalist Abby Martin went on her on-air RT rant (a full-blown rant) about Russia's actions in the Crimea in 2014 when we executed the violent coup d'etat against Ukraine's elected gov't. There was no way any Russian gov't would have approved what Martin said on the air (some of it was wildly inaccurate).

Martin herself said she expected to be fired for her rant. The NYT falsely reported Martin was fired. But Martin was talked to by RT management and continued to work for RT for a year, before quitting normally and taking what she saw was a better job.

Today RT hosts *many* Americans who US TV and mass media refuse because those Americans say things the US gov't and mass media do not want Americans thinking.

Like USMC intelligence officer Scott Ritter.

Ritter was a daily feature on US mass media during the 1990s and was given awards/medals by Bill Clinton for his work lying and spying on our old ally Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Ritter was a literal WMD expert and played the role (literally *acting*) as the tough Marine ""Alpha Dog"" causing a scene to distract Iraqis from the illegal activities his men were doing.

But in the run-up to the torturing war criminal Bush's 2002/3 lies about Iraqi WMD, Ritter was on TV giving his expert opinion about how Bush's claims were false.

But then he was charged with having sex with minors over the Internet -- and he vanished from US TV.

Though the charges were later dropped as BS he has been banned from US TV. His only outlet is places like RT.

For you to dismiss RT as nothing but Putin's propaganda is erroneous. RT bluntly says and admits that it tells its news from ""the Russian perspective"" which is more honest than the BBC, DW or NPR which spins the news for their own country's spin but pretends to be ultra-objective.

RT is just one more perspective in a wise person's knowledge who should be consuming news from *multiple perspectives and making up their own mind.*

Here’s an excerpt of some of the article. 

&gt;	On Thursday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson caused an uproar by promoting the racist, anti-Semitic, patriarchal and conspiratorial “white replacement theory.” Also known as the “great replacement theory,” it stands on the premise that nonwhite immigrants are being imported (sometimes the Jewish community is accused of orchestrating this) to replace white people and white voters. The theory is also an inherent chastisement of white women for having a lower birthrate than nonwhite women.

&gt;As Carlson put it:

&gt;“I know that the left and all the gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term ‘replacement,’ if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters, from the third world. But, they become hysterical because that’s what’s happening, actually. Let’s just say it: That’s true.”

&gt;Carlson continued, “Every time they import a new voter, I become disenfranchised as a current voter.”

&gt;The whole statement is problematic. First, what is the third world? This label originated as a way to categorize countries that didn’t align with Western countries or the former Soviet bloc. It’s now often used to describe poor countries, or developing countries, and by extension, mostly nonwhite majority countries.
When Carlson worries about immigrants from the third world, he is talking about Hispanic, Asian and Black people who he worries will outnumber “current” voters. Current voters, in this formulation, are the white people who make up the majority of the American electorate.

&gt;Second, and revealingly, he is admitting that Republicans do not and will not appeal to new citizens who are immigrants.

&gt;But although white replacement theory is a conspiracy theory, the fact that the percentage of voters who are white in America is shrinking as a percentage of all voters is not. Neither is the fact that white supremacists are panicked about this.",5,[],[],['Joe Biden']

Ten years ago, after overcoming a months-long protest movement and legal battle, a law called Act 10 took effect in Wisconsin. The nondescript name cloaked the most significant attack on labor rights since President Ronald Reagan broke the air traffic controllers union in 1981.

Ostensibly meant to address a shortfall in the state’s budget, Act 10 steeply cut the state’s contribution to workers’ pensions and health care premiums, but its defining feature was to effectively eliminate collective bargaining rights for public employees. Most important, it sparked a nationwide attack on labor that fueled the rise of right-wing populism and helped elect Donald Trump.

Since the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, many historians and political observers — not to mention Democratic politicians — have grown increasingly concerned about the future of American democracy. Those fears have only intensified with the passage of new laws restricting voting rights in Georgia, Florida, Arizona and 14 other states. Yet the Democratic establishment has continued to minimize the importance of labor rights, failing to draw a connection between attacks on organized labor, exemplified by laws like Act 10, and the unraveling of democracy.

That connection is clear from the bitter legacy of Act 10. Introduced by Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, the law mandated that public sector unions hold recertification elections annually — and, unlike in typical democratic elections, unions would need to win a majority of all eligible voters, not just a majority of votes. It outlawed collective bargaining for workplace safety — a crucial issue for workers like corrections officers — and for any issue except base wages; even the raises that workers could negotiate were capped by the rate of inflation. Most revealing was a provision that made it illegal for employers to collect union dues from paychecks, even with a worker’s written consent, though it permitted such deductions for charitable organizations like the United Way.

That provision, coupled with $13 billion in tax cuts passed during Mr. Walker’s tenure (most of which benefited corporations and the state’s wealthiest citizens) and Mr. Walker’s exemption of firefighters and nearly all police unions (many of which endorsed him) from the law, showed how the bill was primarily a political attack against a crucial pillar of financial and organizational support for the state’s Democratic Party.

Mr. Walker underscored the law’s political nature when he privately told a billionaire donor in January 2011, a few weeks before he announced his attack on public employee unions, that it would be part of a “divide and conquer” strategy to pit public and private sector unions against each other to weaken labor’s power overall.",1,['Donald Trump'],[],['Donald Trump']
38758,2021-07-07 16:54:15,Scott Walker’s Wisconsin Paved the Way for Donald Trump’s America,,2021-07-07 16:57:47,AmericanPolitics,t3_ofmypu,"By that measure, Act 10 has been remarkably effective; Wisconsin’s public sector unions have lost about 70 percent of their members on average over the past decade. The diminishment of public employee unions helped pave the way for Mr. Walker to sign a so-called right-to-work law in 2015, breaking his earlier pledge not to do so. Right-to-work laws prohibit unions from requiring workers in a unionized workplace to pay dues, which erodes the union’s finances and bargaining power. Along with Act 10, Wisconsin’s right-to-work law has contributed to a 40 percent decline in the state’s union membership rate since 2011. Now barely 8 percent of Wisconsin’s work force are members of a union, roughly the same percentage as in Alabama, a state with a long and violent anti-labor history.

But Act 10’s impact over the past decade goes far beyond a decline in union membership. The law has damaged the state’s public infrastructure and services, including K-12 public education. According to a survey by the Wisconsin Policy Forum, the number of incoming college freshmen at the state’s four-year universities who intended to become teachers dropped by a third between 2012 and 2018. The loss of collective bargaining rights made teaching less attractive. It has also made teachers’ wages and benefits more uneven across the state. Wealthier school districts can entice sought-after teachers while poorer districts, many of them in rural areas, face persistent teacher shortages and high turnover rates. Wisconsin is also experiencing stagnant wages, regressive tax policies that disproportionately burden working- and middle-class families, and its highest level of income inequality in nearly 100 years.

Wisconsin’s history as a pioneer in the expansion of labor rights — it was the first state to enact a workers’ compensation law and an unemployment insurance program, and to recognize collective bargaining rights for public employees — made it a particularly attractive target for national conservatives. In the wake of Act 10, more than 100 bills curtailing collective bargaining rights were introduced in states across the country. In 2018, the attack on public employee unions was successfully nationalized with the Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME, which essentially instituted a right-to-work law for the country’s public sector unions.

Private sector unions have been targeted, too. The right-to-work movement — which had been founded by an avowed white supremacist named Vance Muse in the 1940s before being taken over by conservative industrialists like Fred Koch — appeared to have petered out by 2010. But over the next decade, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Michigan, the birthplace of the United Auto Workers, joined Wisconsin in becoming right-to-work states. Now 27 states have right-to-work laws.

Such laws have contributed to a seemingly bottomless drop-off in union membership. Today, roughly 10 percent of American workers belong to a union, half the percentage that did so in 1983. The declines in Michigan and Wisconsin were particularly important, because of Mr. Trump’s exceedingly small margin of victories in each state. “Trump’s unexpected victory in 2016 did not lay the groundwork for Republican political dominance,” the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist wrote in 2017. “But the March 2011 signing of Act 10, a dramatic reform of public sector labor laws, by Wisconsin’s Scott Walker certainly did. To understate it: If Act 10 is enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic Party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics. It’s that big a deal.”

While Joe Biden narrowly won back Wisconsin and Michigan last year, the states are increasingly polarized, a trend that has been exacerbated by labor’s demise. As the Economic Policy Institute has shown, the decline in union membership correlates with a rise in income inequality. It is also a central culprit in America’s political dysfunction and in the atomization of the electorate; studies have shown that union members are more active in civil society, more likely to vote and less prone to racial resentment.

While the 2010 midterm elections, which gave Republicans control of state government in 20 states, including Wisconsin, are recognized as a political turning point, the movement that arose against Act 10 is an underappreciated spark for the current progressive revival. The protests in Madison against the bill, which at times drew 100,000 participants, formed the first significant resistance to the Tea Party, while also exposing the powerful right-wing network, spearheaded by the American Legislative Exchange Council, that has been propagating attacks on labor, voting rights and public education in statehouses across the country for decades.

But the Democratic Party establishment distanced itself from the Wisconsin uprising. Notably, President Barack Obama did not go to Wisconsin during the Act 10 protests, betraying a campaign promise to “put on a comfortable pair of walking shoes myself” and “march on that picket line with you” if collective bargaining rights were ever under attack. (Vice President Biden did not go to Wisconsin either.) Outrage over Act 10 prompted an effort to recall Mr. Walker that garnered nearly a million signatures and forced him to face a new election in 2012. But Mr. Obama deliberately avoided campaigning with Tom Barrett, the governor’s Democratic opponent. “This is a gubernatorial race with a guy who was recalled and a challenger trying to get him out of office,” Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama’s deputy campaign spokeswoman, told NBC News. “It has nothing to do with President Obama.”

The fallout from the financial crisis, and Mr. Obama’s tepid economic response to it, helped enable the Tea Party backlash, allowing the movement’s funders to realize long-held ambitions of weakening the labor movement and the public sector under the guise of austerity. That effort was made easier by the Democrats’ embrace of their framing. A few months before Mr. Walker announced Act 10, his predecessor, Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, bragged that he made steeper cuts to size of the state employee work force than any governor in Wisconsin’s history. Mr. Obama, too, championed public austerity, imposing a two-year wage freeze for federal workers just after the 2010 election.

These actions reflected a decades-long shift in the Democratic Party away from working-class voters. In a 1978 speech, President Jimmy Carter announced a plan to cut 20,000 federal workers and cap pay increases for government employees. The following year, Mr. Carter appointed Paul Volcker as the chairman of the Federal Reserve. To reduce inflation, Mr. Volcker, a former vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank, raised the prime interest rate to 20 percent, which sparked a recession, a 10 percent unemployment rate and a wave of deindustrialization that accelerated the transformation of the industrial Midwest into the Rust Belt.

Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement and negotiated the agreement to grant permanent most-favored-nation status to China, decisions that have cost more than four million jobs, a disproportionate number of them well-paying unionized manufacturing jobs. In 2009, Mr. Obama, who had a filibuster-proof Democratic majority, quickly abandoned a promise to require employers to recognize a union when a majority of workers signed cards indicating they wanted one. “Obama and Clinton both surrounded themselves with a lot of Wall Street people who had no clue,” Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., told The Los Angeles Times last month. “We were an annoyance to be dealt with.”

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden promised to be the “most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.” And on his first day in office, he fired Peter Robb, the powerful general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. For decades, Mr. Robb had been a management-side labor lawyer and, in fact, had been Mr. Reagan’s lead attorney when Mr. Reagan fired more than 11,000 striking air traffic controllers, effectively breaking their union. (In a particularly wrenching but revealing irony, the union had endorsed Mr. Reagan.)

Mr. Biden also spoke out in favor of the unionization drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama and has professed support for the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, the most ambitious effort to strengthen labor rights in decades, which passed in the House in March. The bill would, among other things, weaken right-to-work laws, give the N.L.R.B. the power to fine companies that retaliate against organizing workers, and allow many gig workers to be reclassified as employees, making it easier for them to unionize. Mr. Biden replaced a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office — installed by Mr. Trump — with one of Franklin Roosevelt, labor’s greatest ally in the White House.

But Mr. Biden also quickly abandoned an effort to include a $15 minimum wage in the $1.9 trillion reconciliation stimulus package, one of labor’s top priorities, and the PRO Act stands virtually no chance of passage without the elimination of the Senate filibuster, which Mr. Biden has equivocated about.

Meanwhile, labor’s fall continues. Last month, the Supreme Court overruled a California regulation that made it easier for farmworkers to organize. And while this year’s budget proposal by Mr. Walker’s successor, Tony Evers, a moderate Democrat, called for repealing the right-to-work law and much of Act 10, the proposal stands almost no immediate chance of success — the State Legislature has been firmly in Republican control since heavily gerrymandered redistricting maps were passed in 2011.  Other Democratic governors have been downright hostile to labor. Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, a Democrat, opposes an effort to repeal Virginia’s right-to-work law, despite his party’s control of all three branches of state government there.",1,['Donald Trump'],[],"['Barack Obama', 'Joe Biden', 'Bill Clinton']"

If Mr. Biden’s portrait exchange is to be anything more than symbolism, he and other Democratic leaders will need to fight harder to expand labor rights. Labor unrest and growing hostility from the business community helped push Mr. Roosevelt to sign the Wagner Act, a 1935 law that guaranteed private sector workers the right to form unions and to strike. Mr. Roosevelt understood that labor rights were essential, not peripheral, to the New Deal; by empowering workers with a collective voice, they become more active participants in democracy and create a counterweight to the political and economic power of capital. Mr. Roosevelt also understood that labor rights are good politics; Mr. Biden would do well to remember that Democrats’ period of greatest dominance in the country, starting with the New Deal and running through the Great Society, was a time when union membership was at its peak. Labor’s capacity to foster social cohesion is essential to tackling seemingly intractable problems like economic inequality, racism and climate change.

After the Jan. 6 riot, Mr. Walker tweeted out a specious comparison between the violent mob at the Capitol and the peaceful protests against Act 10. As Charles Tubbs, the chief of the Wisconsin State Capitol Police during the weekslong protests in Madison, told me recently, “They were as different as daylight from dark.” Out of an estimated 1.5 million people who participated in the protests at the Capitol, Mr. Tubbs said, only 16 were arrested by the police, nearly all of them for acts of civil disobedience.

But Mr. Walker’s comparison reminded me of a different analogy, one that appeared on a few of the signs held by Act 10 protesters. They warned that one of the Nazis’ first actions after taking power was to ban independent trade unions. That warning underscored labor’s crucial role as a bulwark for democracy, and while it seemed hyperbolic at the time, and maybe still does, it looks more ominous in the aftermath of Jan. 6.

Mr. Biden and other Democratic leaders would do well to remember it.",1,['Donald Trump'],[],[]

Do the US government do the latter? Yep. Absolutely. Lots of random spying on people around the world.

Does it spy on US citizens? Yes. When a US citizen communicates with any foreign national, the above law states that the [US citizen's name is redacted, and must be unmasked through the FISA court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmasking_by_U.S._intelligence_agencies).",3,[],[],['Donald Trump']

'proof'


I'm guessing you're either unfamiliar with the term and haven't bothered to read up on it. “Unmasking” refers to the intelligence community practice of revealing the names of American citizens corresponding with foreign nationals under surveillance. The unmasking of a name can be requested by officials with proper security clearance, provided they have a good reason. If the unmasking request is approved, the name of the US citizen in question is shared *with the person who asked*. In this case, Tucker Carlson's name was illegally leaked to the general public.

You were the one that claimed ""no one spies on lefty journalists"". I was merely addressing your false claim... as being false. You haven't offered any rebuttal.

Correct. Communication of foreign nationals can be monitored under the FISA act as signed by Donald Trump in 2017.

They weren't targeting Tucker Carlson. They were targeting Vladimir Putin. How do you not understand the difference?

Am I okay with the NSA knowing what Biden talked with Putin about? Absolutely.

The only president in US history that tried to hide communication with hostile foreign nations from our own record keepers both secret or public... was [Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/13/trump-putin-meetings-interpreter-notes/2565471002/).

You are claiming that Tucker Carlsons name was unmasked. That is likely the case. FISA court records are secret, so we don't know. You have no idea if the masking went through a FISA court, and the grounds upon which Carlson's name was unmasked.

Then you say Tucker Carlson's name was 'illegally leaked'... those are two separate things, unmasking and leaking. A person can be 'unmasked' legally, and leaked illegally. Or both legally.

Joe Biden doesn't send private emails to Vladimir Putin.

This is what public art subsidies are for. You take the art that even with much goodwill will look horrible on the mantlepiece, and then you give it the bullshit grants, like ""price for diversity in the color spectrum"" and ""stunning and brave palette usage in support of LGBTQ++"". Extra bonus points if you manage to add ""mac donalds grant for the recognition of transgender clowns. ""

Write good things about that painting, say how much you can see current issues worked up in it. 

The other possibility is that you take the people thatn wrote the articles praising George W Bush coming out of hiding again, you grab them by the hair, drag them behind a dumpster, and make sure they get worked over with a brick untill they are unable to pick up a pen anymore. You have a list of the names, those people signed their articles, just make a roadshow out of it.

If this is just fake drama about bad-faith negotiations for policy that both sides know will not happen, all this does is make Democrats look bad.

There's no ""win"" in this, for Democrats to stage a fake dog and pony show over this issue, at THIS point in time (far-removed from any upcoming elections).  

The ONLY possible angle is they're trying to appease conservatives in an attempt to get bipartisan support for say, the Infrastructure bill.  (Which ain't happening). 

I think it's more likely, that Biden is going to do it.  It's more apparent now, that he has the legal standing to do it.  And members of his own party are encouraging him to do it NOW, rather than later, and I think THAT is what they're negotiating over - with applying this pressure.

(that said; it's the rapidly growing consensus that the MAIN problem in this economy, right now, is NOT monetary supply, it's supply of goods and services, thanks to covid, and Trump's idiotic trade policies - so throwing more money at the economy is probably not going to help very much, unless we can also figure out how to resolve the TECHNICAL blocks on supply shortages).",1,['Joe Biden'],[],[]

I don't agree with your stance, but here's an alternative view.

The game was rigged against the clueless students. They were told/sold **Santa Claus fantasies** about how their educations would allow them to pay back massive loans. Everyone was in on the lie/con job: Banks, the colleges, HS guidance counselors, the gov't/politicians, media, economists -- everyone. The rich bought politicians so the students can not even default on their loans via bankruptcy (thanks to politicians like Joe Biden!).

It was a rigged game and the students were the patsies/victims.

The clueless students should have rebelled. They should have **organized** and protested, stopping their payments.

Many are in default, thanks to COVID-19 and our fake sham of an economy.

For the students that struggled and paid off their loans? Good for those clueless people -- they get a [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) award and a good credit score from some thankless corporation.

But meanwhile back in reality, we have a totally f\*cked society. Our gap between the rich and poor is obscene.

We have **an entire generation** that is too poor to buy homes or to generate our ""consumer society"" that we were told was our hallmark.

Banksters and investors are now buying up homes and putting run-of-the-mill single family homes into ""bonds"". The entire US is transforming not into a nation where ""we the people"" own homes/property, but where the rich own the land and we have **huge masses** of people who are permanent renters.

That's a radical transformation of US society going on without our noticing!

Karl Marx predicted this over a century ago, talking about the ""working class"" as ""proletarians-"" -- the class in ancient Roman society that were citizens but who owned nothing but could only sell their labor for enough food to survive. That's what the US is **devolving** into today.

FDR faced something similar in the Great Depression. Then FDR forced the banksters to **write down the principle of their loans** -- the banksters lost big money but US capitalism was saved. Obama bailed the banksters out in 2008/9 and a Democrat president watched *millions of Americans lose their homes* without doing much but give feel-good speeches. (And we wonder why we got Trump!)

So what are we going to do?

* Stick with ""conventional politics"" and watch the US *further* erode into an oligarchy where the rich own everything -- and wait for a revolution?

* Or do something out-of-the-box and attempt to rescue capitalism again?

*Every* significant social gain that ""we the people"" have achieved is because of so-called ""third parties"" and the pressures they exert on the ruling duopoly.

* In the WWI era and shortly after the war the fast growing Socialist Party and the Progressive Party resulted in ""we the people"" getting women the right to vote and the radical power of ""we the people"" getting to directly elect US Senators. That latter amendment fundamentally changed the design of the Constitution and was a big step towards becoming a ""democratic republic.""

Capital responded with the ""Red Scare"" and worked to destroy the Socialist Party, with the American Legion literally burning Socialist Party buildings to the ground in some cities.

* In the Great Depression FDR was elected as a centrist liberal. But the labor movement, the remnants of the Socialist Party and the-then fast growing Communist Party push FDR into moving to the left to ""co-opt the threat"" and ""we the people"" got social security, the 40 hour workweek, welfare, unemployment insurance -- and a whole host of other social benefits.

All because the third parties forced the ruling duopoly to move to the left. Then capital responded after WWII with the McCarthy Era to smash the Communist Party and gut the labor movement.

* In the 1960s a whole host of small so-called ""third parties,"" everything from the Youth Int'l Party (Yippies) to the Black Panther Party, combined with the anti-war movement and civil rights movements to force LBJ and the Democrats to again, move to the left to ""co-opt the threat"" and ""we the people"" got LBJ's Great Society programs.

And again, all because third parties to the left of the Democrats forced the ruling duopoly to move to the left.

This third party dynamic also works the other way too!

* In 1992 billionaire Ross Perot got 19% of the votes of the American people essentially running on a platform of balancing the budget and fiscal conservativism.

Both halves of our ruling duopoly responded. The Democrats under Bill Clinton killed FDR's welfare program, ending the idea that the US gov't has a duty to pay cash to poor people. Clinton ran as a liberal but became a budget-minded president inflicting fiscal austerity on the country. He actually ran a couple of federal gov't budget surpluses -- the first ones in decades. Again, all due to Ross Perot's third party run.

Once Perot and his short-lived Reform Party had disappeared from the political scene, the ruling duopoly went back to running huge budget deficits -- a tried-and-true way of subtly moving money from poor taxpayers to the rich capitalist class buying US Treasury bonds.

Working within the Democrats is insanity.

If we want the country to move to the left, we need to back some third party to the left of the Democrats.

At least they vote that way on election day."" -- Eugene Debs, the socialist presidential candidate who received more than 3% of the vote for president while sitting in a jail cell for opposing WWI.

In your link, the release in question was a trade of prisoners. Standard procedure, happens all the time. We got some guys back, they got some guys back, life continues.

Trump released this guy as part of negotiations towards a peace deal with the Taliban, claiming it would help the process.

The peace deal he then negotiated was a fucking disgrace, immediately freeing FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS while the Taliban barely needed to do anything, simultaneously detailing explicitly when and how the US was going to pull out and giving them FOURTEEN MONTHS to prepare their inevitable breach of the treaty and assault on the entire country the moment we started to leave.

It was also a deal that didn't involve the actual current government of Afghanistan whatsoever, legitimizing the Taliban as leaders and delegitimizing the already shaky government.

It was ***also*** planned for after an election, ensuring that trump could either go back on his word or let the next guy deal with the utter disgrace that was his peace deal.

There's plenty more issues too.

To cover the rest of your possible claims that Obama is to blame somehow, I want you to imagine a scenario.

The first black president pulls us out of Afghanistan. A collapse even faster and more devastating than the one we're seeing now follows.

How does the US population react? Reminder that Obama couldn't wear a tan suit without getting screeched at by assholes.

Obama was trapped by the political damage that pulling out would do to his race. Can't have ""Caused the Afghanistan disaster"" in the books next to the ***first ever*** black president. There's a lot more to it as well, but I want to add only a little more for now.

Bush and ""friends"" started this all. They could have ended it easily at like six different times. They didn't. This war and the results are absolutely on them. 100%. All of this could have been avoided.

The devastating result of the pullout was caused most significantly by Trump being six kinds of bastard and failure. The result of this pullout lies squarely on him, 100%.

Obama couldn't feasibly pull out, so he holds little to no blame for that. His actions, however, are his own. Actions that both Bush and Trump did much worse than. However, Obama is responsible for the damage the actions that were his choice caused. I assure you that a routine prisoner exchange carries no negative connotations though.

Quite true. That's what makes Obama blessing all of Bush's radical precedents and putting a bi-partisan stamp of approval on them so disgusting.

&gt;  Carter (1979 was Russian invasion)

You're repeating US Cold War propaganda as if it was fact.

The US under Jimmy Carter's NSC/geo-political strategist [Zbigniew Brzezinski's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski) enacted a *deliberate plot* to *provoke* the USSR into sending troops into a neighboring country with a UN-recognized leftist gov't. The US did this by arming radical Muslim fundamentalists to attack the leftist gov't who was doing ""radical"" things like having female college professors and giving equal rights to women.

The Soviets refused several Afghan requests to send troops, only sending military and economic aid. The USSR talked diplomatically to the US to get us to cut off our aid to the radical Muslims. The Russians, having fought radical Muslims for *centuries,* said this was an issue ""bigger"" than the Cold War. The US refused the mediation attempts and continued to arm people like our old ally Osama Bin Laden.

The next request the USSR got from Afghanistan for troops the USSR agreed and sent them.

The US called that an ""invasion"" -- even though our secret scheme was to provoke that exact thing to happen!

Carter then pulled out the stops on one of the largest propaganda campaigns in history. We got our NATO vassals and other countries to join in denouncing the ""Soviet invasion."" And we went so far as to jointly boycott the 1980 Olympics -- all due to the Soviet ""invasion"" we deliberately provoked. This was pushed by the gov't, media and our entire society.

After the USSR broke up Brzezinski gave a media interview where he bluntly talked about excitedly contacting Carter, bubbling with excitement about how the US now had the chance to give the USSR its ""own Vietnam.""

Reagan spent *billions* to arm those religious nuts. We coordinated with the Saudi dictator to recruit Muslim fundamentalists from all over the world. The Saudis and US then implemented ""schools"" (called madrassas the Arabic word for ""school"") to indoctrinate the Muslims into radical Wahhabi Islam and the CIA and Pakistanis trained them to fight. Those students were called taliban (the Arabic word for ""student"").

&gt; ""They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance."" -- US President Ronald Reagan, talking about Osama Bin Laden and the fanatical Muslim terrorists that the US was backing/training/arming in Afghanistan, people that we know today as ""Taliban.""",5,['Joe Biden'],[],[]

He served as a counselor to President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1966 to 1968 and was President Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor from 1977 to 1981. As a scholar, Brzezinski belonged to the realist school of international relations, standing in the geopolitical tradition of Halford Mackinder and Nicholas J. Spykman.

The key one is the ""[Bush Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_Doctrine)."" Bush established the concept that the US has a ""right"" to attack any country we want to. That directly trashes the UN Charter and int'l law dating back to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia.

Our mass media and the public swallowed that ""Nazi-like logic"" essentially without debate.

We then enacted that **evil** policy to attack Iraq. We made up literal lies and propaganda, our Congress publicly talked about using Iraq's oil wealth to pay for our war, and we invaded the country to overthrow our old ally. And when the Iraqi people heroically fought back against our illegal invasion and occupation, we tortured their patriots.

Yet nowhere is this talked about as criminal in the US media!

We refuse to allow ICC war crimes investigators into the US and our gov't still preaches hypocritically about ""human rights"" -- with our ""free press"" not pointing out the hypocrisy.

The blatant US violation of treaties -- everything from Bush ordering *and defending* torture to tearing up the ABM treaty both of our worthless, war-loving ruling political parties accepted.

One could go on and on.

And when Obama was elected, Europe gave him an undeserved Nobel Peace Prize to put a happy spin on the US as the sellout rubber-stamped and put a bi-partisan stamp of approval on all of Bush's policies. While Obama admitted US torture, he never even apologized for it!",2,['Joe Biden'],[],[]

The Bush Doctrine refers to multiple interrelated foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. These principles include unilateralism and the use of preemptive war. Charles Krauthammer first used the phrase in June 2001 to describe the Bush Administration's ""unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol."" After the 9/11 attack, the phrase described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 war in Afghanistan.

We're being driven by a far-right version of ""American Taliban"" pushing an agenda. As the article states:

&gt; The far right spent years unfolding a deliberate strategy on abortion. First, because they’ve not yet successfully overturned Roe, they’ve instead tried to undermine it. In many parts of the country, GOP state lawmakers have passed ridiculous requirements for anyone to get an abortion: misleading and manipulative counseling to discourage those trying to get an abortion, compulsory ultrasounds, medically unnecessary waiting periods and on and on. And they’ve mandated equally absurd regulations on clinics, making abortion care so complicated that clinics effectively cannot operate. These laws have successfully shut down clinics across dozens of states, with six states having just one abortion clinic open.

&gt; The second part of the strategy? Installing far-right judges who will aid this sabotage. Toward the end of President Barack Obama’s term, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked more than 100 judicial appointees, and then under President Donald Trump filled them at breakneck speeds with the most extreme, far-right reactionaries available. The result: Courts like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is, in the words of University of Texas Law Professor Stephen I. Vladeck, “as conservative a federal appeals court as any of us have seen in our lifetimes.” Last week, the 5th Circuit jumped to prevent an injunction that would have stopped S.B. 8 from taking effect.",3,[],[],"['Barack Obama', 'Donald Trump']"

**February 2:** “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

**February 24:** “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

**February 25:** “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

**February 25:** “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

**February 26:** “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

**February 26:** “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

**February 27:** “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

**February 28:** “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

**March 2:** “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

**March 2:** “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

**March 4:** “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to **work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

**March 5:** “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

**March 5:** “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

**March 6:** “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

**March 6:** “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

**March 6:** “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

**March 6:** “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

**March 8:** “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

**March 9:** “This blindsided the world.”

You can easily see the lies and the spin evolving as the BSing braggart poser changes his story.

And remember, in 2018 Donald Trump closed the Obama-created Pandemic Response Team that would have been invaluable in this current Covid-19 crisis:  [“I Don’t Know Anything About It,” Trump Says About White House’s Elimination of Pandemic Response Team](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/i-dont-know-anything-about-it-trump-says-about-his-white-house-eliminating-the-pandemic-response-team.html).",3,[],[],['Donald Trump']

The problem for the Democrats is that there is no unifying ""evil-doer"" to motivate people to go to the polls in the mid-terms -- only the vague threat of losing control of the House and Senate.

With a pro-corporate war-monger in office, business as usual, there is no excitement, no motivation for people to go out and vote. So Democrats will likely see a disaster in the mid-terms.

That's being realistic but seems hopelessly negative. St. Obama preached that we should ""keep hope alive.""

If that happens they'll cannonize the bastard, and the corpse won't be making embarrassing noises to trip them up. 

Start a war ? Yes, that has been an often used tool that many politicians in many countries have used in the past to wipe their slates clean. There is, however, a big difficulty in pulling that rabbit out of the hat so soon after a major military defeat - Afghanistan. Russia waited 9 years from its defeat in 1905 before it chanced another defeat. A large portion of the population of various political camps will be war-shy for some time. The USA would have to depend on the recklessness - and stupidity - of its opponents. Neither Russia not China is likely to be so reckless and stupid. They will play the same game of bluff that they have been playing for years now. Neither country has *significant* domestic opposition to their regimes that *they* would have to distract. Iran ?

Every one of traitor Trump's 50+ court challenges were either thrown out of court or were lost in court. The cases were so ridiculous it cost Rudy Guiliani his law license.

As his Wikipedia article: [""Post-election lawsuits related to the 2020 United States presidential election""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election) summarizes:

&gt; After the 2020 United States presidential election, the campaign for incumbent President Donald Trump and others filed and lost at least 63 lawsuits[1] contesting election processes, vote counting, and the vote certification process in multiple states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.[2] Among the judges who dismissed the lawsuits were some appointed by Trump himself.[3]

&gt; Nearly all the suits were dismissed or dropped due to lack of evidence.[4] Judges, lawyers, and other observers described the suits as ""frivolous""[5] and ""without merit"".[6][7] In one instance, the Trump campaign and other groups seeking his reelection collectively lost multiple cases in six states on a single day.[8] Only one ruling was initially in Trump's favor: the timing within which first-time Pennsylvania voters must provide proper identification if they wanted to “cure” their ballots. This ruling affected very few votes,[9] and it was later overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.[10]",11,[],[],['Donald Trump']

44545,2021-10-08 22:47:51,Why Does Congress Fight Over Childcare But Not F-35s?,,2021-10-08 23:43:29,AmericanPolitics,t3_q48rdx,"IMO a great article that's a must-read. Plenty of links to support the author's points, A smattering of paragraphs to whet your appetite:

&gt; Real fiscal insanity is what Congress does year after year, taking most of its discretionary spending off the table and handing it over to the Pentagon before even considering the country’s urgent domestic needs. Maintaining this pattern, Congress just splashed out $12 billion for 85 more F-35 warplanes, 6 more than Trump bought last year, without debating the relative merits of buying more F-35s vs. investing $12 billion in education, healthcare, clean energy or fighting poverty.

...

&gt; After adjusting for inflation, this enormous budget is comparable to the peak of Trump’s arms build-up in 2020, and is only 10% below the post-WWII record set by Bush II in 2008 under cover of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would give Joe Biden the dubious distinction of being the fourth post-Cold War U.S. president to militarily outspend every Cold War president, from Truman to Bush I.

...

&gt; As with Biden’s failure to quickly rejoin the JCPOA with Iran, the time to act on cutting the military budget and reinvesting in domestic priorities was in the first weeks and months of his administration. His inaction on these issues, like his deportation of thousands of desperate asylum seekers, suggests that he is happier to continue Trump’s ultra-hawkish policies than he will publicly admit.

...

&gt; Even Republicans favored cutting $14 billion, while Democrats supported a much larger $100 billion cut. That would be more than the 10% cut in the failed Ocasio-Cortez Amendment, which garnered support from only 86 Democratic Reps and was opposed by 126 Dems and every Republican.

...

&gt; **A study by the Political Economy Research Center at the University of Massachusetts found that military spending creates fewer jobs than almost any other form of government spending. It found that $1 billion invested in the military yields an average of 11,200 jobs, while the same amount invested in other areas yields: 26,700 jobs when invested in education; 17,200 in healthcare; 16,800 in the green economy; or 15,100 jobs in cash stimulus or welfare payments.**",3,[],[],['Joe Biden']

…Rudy Giuliani! (Because of course he did.)

---



Not long ago, Republicans were a party in disarray. They had lost the presidency, the House and the Senate. They regularly expressed the fear that if they didn’t support efforts to overturn elections, their most extreme supporters would literally kill them and their families. Donald Trump, deeply unpopular and perhaps the greatest sore loser in history, still held them in his grip.

But now they have their groove back.

The GOP is still in many ways a chaotic mess. But Republicans are demonstrating their mastery of opposition politics. They’re like an experienced team of technicians deftly using their finely honed tools to mix ingredients and produce a chemical reaction. What they’re manufacturing happens to be a cloud of poison, but boy do these folks know what they’re doing.

Consider Attorney General Merrick Garland’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. It’s a committee stocked with Republicans who have mastered the art of fake outrage and will likely to run for president in 2024 if Trump opts out: Ted Cruz (Tex.), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.).

Garland was peppered with questions about various inane right-wing preoccupations (What is he doing about Hunter Biden? Will he prosecute Anthony S. Fauci?), but what really had the senators animated was a memo that the Department of Justice released a few weeks ago instructing federal prosecutors to work with local officials to address threats and intimidation directed at school board members and educators.

That memo made clear that the department wouldn’t restrict anyone’s First Amendment rights, but the conservative elite knew political gold when they saw it. They immediately began telling their gullible audiences that President Biden’s Justice Department wanted to brand every concerned parent a terrorist.

So Wednesday’s hearing turned into a truly epic performance of pretend indignation. Sasse and Cruz denounced “the politicization of the DOJ.” Hawley accused Garland of seeking to prosecute parents merely “because they want to be involved in their children’s education.” Hawley and Cotton both called on him to resign, “in disgrace,” as Cotton put it.

From a substantive standpoint, the hearing was not particularly consequential: No new information was revealed, and no legislation will result because of it. Yet on Fox News, the central hub of the conservative media wheel, they treated the hearing as though it was as important as the moon landing or the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Fox carried parts of the hearing live, then recycled the sound bites from Republican senators over and over throughout the day and into the next. Senators were then brought on Fox shows to recount their triumphant battle; other Fox hosts made the hearing the subject of extended rants.

Meanwhile, throughout the conservative world, the issue of “education” — i.e., the rage of conservative parents over the idea that their children might be taught that racism is something more than a 19th-century curiosity — has consumed the right. On National Review, you could find half a dozen articles just on Wednesday and Thursday about the Garland hearing and its associated issues.

This is happening while Glenn Youngkin, the party’s candidate for governor in Virginia, has decided to center his campaign on the supposed threat of critical race theory. The closeness of that race has convinced everyone on the right that this issue will be extremely profitable for them, paying untold dividends in rage and resentment, the fuel that powers their movement.

So let’s pull our view back.

There is no real federal policy question at issue here. And if there were, these senators would barely know what to do with it; none of them has ever written a truly significant piece of legislation. That’s not part of their jobs as they see them.

They don’t care any more about the details of school curriculums than they did about proper email management procedures or consular security when they used those “issues” to torpedo Hillary Clinton.

Benghazi is the real model here: a regrettable incident that they successfully milked for years as though it were the crime of the century, mounting no fewer than eight separate congressional investigations.

But here’s a newfound demonstration of their skill: Back then, they had control of the House and then the Senate, giving them the institutional authority to create news events by holding hearings at which they could preen and shout. They don’t have that now. But their propaganda system is both agile and mature, so that as soon as they find an issue that appears to induce the proper anger among their base, they can find ways to whip it into an absolute frenzy.

At some point they’ll decide that this has run its course, and they’ll find something else to pretend to be mad about. If you watch Fox for a day, you’ll see a dozen fake issues being road-tested to see what might catch on. But one thing is clear: Republicans are back in their comfort zone.",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

When you elect Obama in 2008 and then stay home in 2010 because you got Obamacare instead of Single Payer, 

I think that's a **good** thing -- progressives won't allow the corporate-funded/controlled Democrats to screw them over.

This is why those progressives should be voting for a third party -- to force the Democrats to act like real Democrats instead of moving to the right to be Republican-lites like their corporate funders want them to be.

&gt; You have never accomplished ANYTHING with your strategy. 

The only way to enact change with our 2 ruling parties is to vote for a so-called ""third party"" to the left of the Democrats. The Democrats will be forced to move to the left to co-opt the ""threat.""

The only way the US people get significant social change is when we vote for a 3rd party.

* In the so-called ""Progressive Era"" around/after WWI the fast-growing Progressive Party and Socialist Party forced the 2 ruling parties to give ""we the people"" the right to vote directly for US Senators and gave women the right to vote. (The US ruling class responded with the ""Red Scare"" to destroy/weaken the Socialist Party and left.)

* In the Great Depression, FDR was pressured by the fast-growing Communist Party, the Socialist Party and labor movement to enact the New Deal. Without that third-party pressure FDR would have stayed the centrist that he ran as. (The US ruling class responded after WWII with the ""McCarthy Era"" to destroy the Communist Party and eviscerate the labor movement.)

* In the 1960s LBJ was pressured by a swath of small leftist parties (everything from the Youth Int'l Party (the Yippies) to the Black Panther Party) to enact the Great Society series of social programs.

Again, the only time ""we the people"" get dramatic social advancements is when we vote for third parties and force the ruling duopoly to toss us crumbs to placate us.

This third-party dynamic also works for the right too!

* In 1992 when Ross Perot got 19% of the popular vote for president, Perot was running on essentially the single issue of fiscal conservatism -- balancing the budget.

  So the liberal Bill Clinton became a budget-wielding austerity president. Clinton happily worked with Republicans and ended FDR's welfare program and the right of Americans to get cash payments if they're poor. But Clinton moved so far to the right that he balanced a couple of budgets.

Today we'll be played. We saw what we got by electing Obama -- he rejected nat'l health care and fed us to the immoral health insurance companies with the Heritage Foundation-invented ObamaCare.

It's the same thing with Biden. Until we start voting for a third party the Democrats will treat the left just like they treat organized labor -- they'll spout rhetoric, demand their vote, and ignore them after the election.

&gt; ""The people can have anything they want. The trouble is, they do not want anything. At least they vote that way on election day."" -- Eugene Debs, the socialist presidential candidate who received more than 3% of the vote for president while sitting in a jail cell for opposing WWI.",1,[],[],['Bill Clinton']

---

Back in July, Kay Ivey, governor of Alabama, had some strong and sensible things to say about Covid-19 vaccines. “I want folks to get vaccinated,” she declared. “That’s the cure. That prevents everything.” She went on to say that the unvaccinated are “letting us down.”

Three months later Ivey directed state agencies not to cooperate with federal Covid-19 vaccination mandates.

Ivey’s swift journey from common sense and respect for science to destructive partisan nonsense — nonsense that is killing tens of thousands of Americans — wasn’t unique. On the contrary, it was a recapitulation of the journey the whole Republican Party has taken on issue after issue, from tax cuts to the Big Lie about the 2020 election.

When we talk about the G.O.P.’s moral descent, we tend to focus on the obvious extremists, like the conspiracy theorists who claim that climate change is a hoax and Jan. 6 was a false flag operation. But the crazies wouldn’t be driving the Republican agenda so completely if it weren’t for the cowards, Republicans who clearly know better but reliably swallow their misgivings and go along with the party line. And at this point crazies and cowards essentially make up the party’s entire elected wing.

Consider, for example, the claim that tax cuts pay for themselves. In 1980 George H.W. Bush, running against Ronald Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination, called that assertion “voodoo economic policy.” Everything we’ve seen since then says that he was right. But Bush soon climbed down, and by 2017 even supposed “moderates” like Susan Collins accepted claims that the Trump tax cut would reduce, not increase, the budget deficit. (It increased the deficit.)

Or consider climate change. As recently as 2008 John McCain campaigned for president in part on a proposal to put a cap on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. But at this point Republicans in Congress are united in their opposition to any substantive action to limit global warming, with 30 G.O.P. senators outright denying the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activities are causing climate change.

The falsehoods that are poisoning America’s politics tend to share similar life histories. They begin in cynicism, spread through disinformation and culminate in capitulation, as Republicans who know the truth decide to acquiesce in lies.

Take the claim of a stolen election. Donald Trump never had any evidence on his side, but he didn’t care — he just wanted to hold on to power or, failing that, promulgate a lie that would help him retain his hold on the G.O.P. Despite the lack of evidence and the failure of every attempt to produce or create a case, however, a steady drumbeat of propaganda has persuaded an overwhelming majority of Republicans that Joe Biden’s victory was illegitimate.

And establishment Republicans, who at first pushed back against the Big Lie, have gone quiet or even begun to promote the falsehood. Thus on Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal published, without corrections or fact checks, a letter to the editor from Trump that was full of demonstrable lies — and in so doing gave those lies a new, prominent platform.

The G.O.P.’s journey toward what it is now with respect to Covid-19 — an anti-vaccine, objectively pro-pandemic party — followed the same trajectory.

Although Republicans like Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott claim that their opposition to vaccine requirements is about freedom, the fact that both governors have tried to stop private businesses from requiring customers or staff to be vaccinated shows this is a smoke screen. Pretty clearly, the anti-vaccine push began as an act of politically motivated sabotage. After all, a successful vaccination campaign that ended the pandemic would have been good political news for Biden.

We should note, by the way, that this sabotage has, so far at least, paid off. While there are multiple reasons many Americans remain unvaccinated, there’s a strong correlation between a county’s political lean and both its vaccination rate and its death rate in recent months. And the persistence of Covid, which has in turn been a drag on the economy, has been an important factor dragging down Biden’s approval rating.

More important for the internal dynamics of the G.O.P., however, is that many in the party’s base have bought into assertions that requiring vaccination against Covid-19 is somehow a tyrannical intrusion of the state into personal decisions. In fact, many Republican voters appear to have turned against longstanding requirements that parents have their children vaccinated against other contagious diseases.

And true to form, elected Republicans like Governor Ivey who initially spoke in favor of vaccines have folded and surrendered to the extremists, even though they must know that in so doing they will cause many deaths.

I’m not sure exactly why cowardice has become the norm among elected Republicans who aren’t dedicated extremists. But if you want to understand how the G.O.P. became such a threat to everything America should stand for, the cowards are at least as important a factor as the crazies.",2,[],[],"['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']"

It’s who owns the machine and not who the owners pay to operate it. The wealthy always want the focus on income and not them. The wealthy certainly have tremendous influence over how opportunity is afforded people. Who has more?

These things are linked. The distinction is an issue of semantics. yes wealth is part of the issue but also they both facilitate each other. Some degree of wealth facilitates higher than everyone else income and high income facilitates wealth as opposed to just having money. 

&gt;You were doing so well with withholding judgement and now you’re jumping to conclusions. Why? Sweden took a very right of center approach relative to America but only 0.1452% of their population has been killed compared to 0.2267% of ours. That’s three of us for every two of them. How were they able to go right of center and do better than we have by this key measure?

How was Sweden right of center? 

&gt;So you want to overthrow the government and replace it with a communist one? I can’t support violence or revolution.

No. The U.S. constitution at it's core has a lot of great things about it. It just also has a nasty side of protecting the wealthy. Violently overthrowing the government is not a good way to go about things. Because you don't know what will come after. Nor do I really want communism. Just a system not built with exploitation being the corner stone like it is now. 

&gt;How do you reconcile this belief and giving any support for Democrats given their embrace of the CIA? 

The democrats are more pro-humanity than republicans. Because of that, given my choices, they are the option that I go with right now. That being said Joe Biden is a huge contributor to drug laws in the U.S. and Kamala Harris is a cop. Neither of them are particularly preferable *except* when compared to the overt corruption of the trump campaign. 

Obama was bad too. So was clinton. Not *as* bad as Bush or Trump or Raegan but they were bad but in a smart and legalistic way that has contributed to the U.S. we live in today.

&gt;The US government rules a global military empire. Some believe voting for Democrats can change that. Seems awfully naive to me.

I do not believe that. The democrats vote for the military/funding the RnD/locking up all the tax dollars that could be used for nationalized healthcare and instead...fund war. 

&gt;Haiti isn’t blameless for its problems. It has always been poorly governed and hopelessly corrupt.

Isn't it weird how all of these post-euro colonies are all ""not blameless for their current state"" and ""hopelessly corrupt""? And then every time someone promising for the people there comes into power they somehow get murdered or removed from office via some other form of coercion? 

&gt;It’s critical that we teach people abstract math. It’s possible to realize proof in mathematics.

You know what I mean. There are things that are true. The abstract math is like the top of the pyramid. 2+2=4 is the bottom of the pyramid. Our society is at a state where it is starting to question the 2+2=4 at the base state not at the highly educated abstract math level. Or there is an incredibly vocal minority that is creating these questions in other peoples heads. 

&gt;The problem with restricting speech is who can be trusted to do it? Nobody can be trusted to do it. Power corrupts.

&amp;

&gt;Of course. OAN/Newsmax are ridiculous.

So then couldn't we make the argument that maybe in the context of a major media corp they *should* have limitations on free speech? They aren't a personal thing. They also can perpetuate bad information and present it as real and true. That's why we have the climate change crisis that we are just diving into like it's nothing and people continue to question whether or not it's real. Objectively it's a thing that is happening regardless of personal belief.

&gt;I don’t know. It’s weird around me. I live in LA and we are very observant of masking. Vaccination rates are very high in affluent areas and low in poor areas. Orange County is a short drive away. They’re not observant about masking. Their vaccination rates are higher than LA County rates. We have suffered higher rates of infections and deaths. This suggests to me that local regulations are sensible

I live in a nicer area of the midwest and peak lockdown pre-vaccine there would be people walking around maskless like they were somehow flexing their oddball freedom. The idea that wearing a mask was tied to their freedom wasn't something that originated in their heads. That was an idea that was put there via someone on the internet. Some of those people were on TV sitting in an expensive studio in front of a camera. With however many people that have died *now* those talking heads and random people on the internet have convinced other people to facilitate someones death.

There have to be some protections for private property in my opinion.

&gt; Violently overthrowing the government is not a good way to go about things. Because you don't know what will come after. Nor do I really want communism. Just a system not built with exploitation being the corner stone like it is now.

I think that’s a much larger problem than our government.  But the corruption in our government is certainly related to exploitation.

&gt; The democrats are more pro-humanity than republicans.

Their rhetoric is more focused on some humanitarian issues.  But their rhetoric is racist and divisive just like the Republicans.  I find their embrace of the CIA more disgusting than anything Republicans are doing.  What do you think the CIA does?

&gt; That being said Joe Biden is a huge contributor to drug laws in the U.S. and Kamala Harris is a cop.

Joe Biden championed the unconscionable invasion of Iraq in the Senate.  How many hundreds of thousands have died in that war?  Humanitarian?

Kamala Harris is so pretentious and phony it’s ridiculous.  She might actually be a worse retail politician than Hillary Clinton.  It’s astonishing.

&gt; Obama was bad too.

I wonder if Obama and/or his mother were CIA.  Interesting life story for her.  The “community organizer” schtick is right out of the CIA playbook.  Regardless, he was good for us in many respects and helped repair our international image while doing basically the same shit as Bush but relying more on flying robots to kill.  Smooth indeed.

&gt; So was clinton.

Clinton was way too close to Epstein and his honeypot to compromise powerful men for Israel.  He’s a disgusting man.

&gt; Not as bad as Bush or Trump or Raegan but they were bad but in a smart and legalistic way that has contributed to the U.S. we live in today.

Bush is a war criminal.  He lied us to war - a crime against peace.  He’s arguably the worst President in our history.

&gt; I do not believe that. The democrats vote for the military/funding the RnD/locking up all the tax dollars that could be used for nationalized healthcare and instead...fund war.

Yup.  And they smeared Tulsi Gabbard for calling them out for it.  The Democrats pro war authoritarian “progressive” schtick is utter bullshit.

&gt; Isn't it weird how all of these post-euro colonies are all ""not blameless for their current state"" and ""hopelessly corrupt""? 

No.  I think Haiti is a good example.  They committed horrible atrocities as they won their freedom on half of the island.  But they didn’t defeat the global empires that rule the world.  They’ve been largely cut off from the fruits of those empires since.  Zimbabwe is another great example.  They have seized property from white farmers and redistributed it to political cronies.  But killing or exiling those farmers didn’t end the claims.  That property was leveraged to buy farm equipment, seed, etc.  Take from global banks and they will screw you.  Zimbabwe used to produce food for export.  Now they are dependent on handouts to stave off starvation.

&gt; You know what I mean. There are things that are true.

There is objective truth.  But much of it is ignored in our public dialogue and politics.  That’s how people end up talking past each other.  Pretending that one side is good (right) and the other bad (wrong) is the classic way to divide and rule.

&gt; Or there is an incredibly vocal minority that is creating these questions in other peoples heads.

Yes.  Our elites and their media.

&gt; So then couldn't we make the argument that maybe in the context of a major media corp they should have limitations on free speech?

We have always had limits on free speech.  Publications can be sued for libel.  We exempted technology platforms from that liability but should revisit that decision.  They are using censorship and suppression to editorialize.

If we are going to limit free expression who will we empower to silence people?

That’s the problem.  Nobody can be trusted with that power.  Free speech isn’t perfect, it’s just the best alternative.

&gt; I live in a nicer area of the midwest and peak lockdown pre-vaccine there would be people walking around maskless like they were somehow flexing their oddball freedom.

I see that more in Vegas than in LA.  The indoor mask requirement there is a joke to me.

I don’t think masking is a big deal and follow the rules where I find myself.  But I don’t think we should silence debate on the efficacy and appropriateness of mask mandates.  Question everything.  No sacred cows.",1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

Most people die with almost zero wealth. If you want to focus on inequity tax wealth. If you want to protect the wealthy and tax everybody else focus on income. That’s reality.

I can't argue with that. I do think both need to be addressed though.

&gt;Sweden did not impose mandatory controls. They did not have a lockdown.

Based on a quick google search that also appears to be because swedes were following guidelines. 

The need for lock downs only came about as the result of people not following guidelines or taking things seriously.

&gt;I think that’s a much larger problem than our government. But the corruption in our government is certainly related to exploitation. 

When I say ""system"" I'm talking beyond the scope of the government. For example Walmart exploited laws that (in hindsight) should have been in place to protect small businesses. They weren't and mom and pop retailers died as a result. Those same people who once ran those shops are now paid poverty wages so the government can subsidize their income via food stamps and other assistance. 

&gt;Their rhetoric is more focused on some humanitarian issues. But their rhetoric is racist and divisive just like the Republicans. I find their embrace of the CIA more disgusting than anything Republicans are doing. What do you think the CIA does?

We're on the same page in this regard. The CIA is going to be remembered as one of the most evil organizations in history. 

&gt;Joe Biden championed the unconscionable invasion of Iraq in the Senate. How many hundreds of thousands have died in that war? Humanitarian?

&gt;Kamala Harris is so pretentious and phony it’s ridiculous. She might actually be a worse retail politician than Hillary Clinton. It’s astonishing.

I agree. He's massively preferable to trump. Everyone in government voted for the invasion of Iraq. 

&gt;I wonder if Obama and/or his mother were CIA. Interesting life story for her. The “community organizer” schtick is right out of the CIA playbook. Regardless, he was good for us in many respects and helped repair our international image while doing basically the same shit as Bush but relying more on flying robots to kill. Smooth indeed. 

I doubt this. But Democrats are like James Bond and the Republicans are like the army in a WW2 movie. That's how I conceive of their international policy anyway.

&gt;No. I think Haiti is a good example. They committed horrible atrocities as they won their freedom on half of the island. But they didn’t defeat the global empires that rule the world. They’ve been largely cut off from the fruits of those empires since. Zimbabwe is another great example. They have seized property from white farmers and redistributed it to political cronies.

Zimbabwe used to produce food for export. Now they are dependent on handouts to stave off starvation.

Zimbabwe is another post colonial country. The white farmers only had the land as the result of white settlers committing atrocities. 

Then about Haiti...it was a *slave* revolt. Of course they did terrible things. You'd do the same as a slave revolting against former masters. 

&gt;There is objective truth. But much of it is ignored in our public dialogue and politics. That’s how people end up talking past each other. Pretending that one side is good (right) and the other bad (wrong) is the classic way to divide and rule.

Republicans are Fascists:

Far-right authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.

Dictatorial power/authoritarianism: The January 6th insurrection attempted to install trump as dictator. Large parts of the party including a significant portion of elected officials were complicit or actively assisted in the attempted coup. Their failure does not mean they're not fascist, just like Hitler's failure in the Beer Hall Putsch didn't mean he wasn't. For lack of proper punishment, Hitler claimed power a few years later and began his dictatorship, a result we can look forward to if people like you continue to deny the fascism of the Republicans. Again, this wasn't a small contingent of the party. 8 Senators and 139 Representatives of the Republican party voted to overturn a fair and safe election immediately after the attack that threatened their own fucking lives. AFTER the attack. It's noteworthy that several of those who had been signaling they would vote in line to overturn stood down after the attack (specifically, Senators Loeffler, Daines, and Braun, again all republican, and likely some unmentioned Representatives too, though I've no evidence to back that aside from probability).

Forcible suppression of the opposition: the number of times I've seen elected officials, particularly trump, on the right make threats or even take actual steps towards violent suppression of the left, ranging from the campaign slogan ""lock her up"" in 2016 for no reason other than buttery males and Benjamin Ghazi (neither of which are a tenth as bad as it relates to Hillary as any single facet of Trump's history, one of which is literally not her fault at all, and the other of which has been done by the Trump family multiple times with few to no one giving a fuck) to sending violent troops to attack the BLM protests of 2020 (who, again, were protestors until far-right instigators and cops (whoops, tautology) started the violence in almost every case). Also, once again, the Jan 6 insurrection attempted to find and kill the Democratic leadership as well as anyone else who stood in the way of the seizing of power, most notably their own damn vice president who had become a target because he refused to bow to the will of the fascists.

In terms of economy, fascism usually takes a highly social darwinist approach, opposed to social welfare (much like the republican party in general)... At least, right up until they realize how necessary it is anyway. Honestly, the economics of fascism is strange and all over the place, frequently dependant on the current situation to figure out how they can best empower the leadership and suppress the people. It's arguable that fascism has no specific economic basis. So that's something. It's worth mentioning that the two primary fascist governments spoken of, WWII Italy and Germany, made heavy partnerships with big business, not unlike modern republicans.

Fascism tends to suppress women, prevent abortion of any they consider ""desirable"" and force death on any they consider ""undesirable"" (They haven't managed to gain enough control to do this yet in America, but they're trying). It also condemns those who don't fit their ""perfect"" person (the physically weak, LGBTQ, other races) which fits well with the republican anti-everything stance.

Ultranationalist you need look no further than the everpresent MAGA catchphrase and hyper-patriotic bullshit.

Fascism is totalitarian, trying to demonize and force out anyone who isn't of the right party. Again, democrats are demonized by republicans, and they'd be suppressing us and forcing us out if they could muster the support. As it is, they suppress and force out anyone on their side who doesn't toe the line, like Liz Cheney, ousted for admitting Trump lost and Biden won.

I could go on. Yes, the republican party, particularly under Donald John Trump, displays every imaginable sign of fascism.

Just because they haven't taken full control and are doing a shit job of it doesn't mean they aren't fascist.

Second copy-paste to reinforce the point: 

I can't speak for poli-sci or history scholarship in general, but Umberto Eco, a leading italian academic (who unfortunately passed recently) has written a great deal on fascism, and in his 1995 essay ""Ur-Fascism"" set forward some principles by which one can recognize fascism in the modern day, and they share a great deal in common with this list from the Holocaust Museum. In fact, he puts forward 14 as well:

1.The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

2.The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

3.The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

4.Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

5.Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

6.Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

7.The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

8.The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

9.Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

10.Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

11.Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

12.Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

13.Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

14.Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

I think ""fascism"" as an insult can be a little watered down, but...like, anyone can be called an ""asshole"" as well and that doesn't mean their aren't straight out-and-out assholes out there.

I prefer Umberto Eco's reflections on growing up in Fascist Italy through his essay Ur Fascism

https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf

He points out that, as an ideology, it is sort of malleable and Italian Fascism is different from Nazism, but there are concrete structures and themes.

Since you didn't bother, I will.

Republicans are Fascists:

Far-right authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.

Dictatorial power/authoritarianism: The January 6th insurrection attempted to install trump as dictator. Large parts of the party including a significant portion of elected officials were complicit or actively assisted in the attempted coup. Their failure does not mean they're not fascist, just like Hitler's failure in the Beer Hall Putsch didn't mean he wasn't. For lack of proper punishment, Hitler claimed power a few years later and began his dictatorship, a result we can look forward to if people like you continue to deny the fascism of the Republicans. Again, this wasn't a small contingent of the party. 8 Senators and 139 Representatives of the Republican party voted to overturn a fair and safe election immediately after the attack that threatened their own fucking lives. AFTER the attack. It's noteworthy that several of those who had been signaling they would vote in line to overturn stood down after the attack (specifically, Senators Loeffler, Daines, and Braun, again all republican, and likely some unmentioned Representatives too, though I've no evidence to back that aside from probability).

Forcible suppression of the opposition: the number of times I've seen elected officials, particularly trump, on the right make threats or even take actual steps towards violent suppression of the left, ranging from the campaign slogan ""lock her up"" in 2016 for no reason other than buttery males and Benjamin Ghazi (neither of which are a tenth as bad as it relates to Hillary as any single facet of Trump's history, one of which is literally not her fault at all, and the other of which has been done by the Trump family multiple times with few to no one giving a fuck) to sending violent troops to attack the BLM protests of 2020 (who, again, were protestors until far-right instigators and cops (whoops, tautology) started the violence in almost every case). Also, once again, the Jan 6 insurrection attempted to find and kill the Democratic leadership as well as anyone else who stood in the way of the seizing of power, most notably their own damn vice president who had become a target because he refused to bow to the will of the fascists.

In terms of economy, fascism usually takes a highly social darwinist approach, opposed to social welfare (much like the republican party in general)... At least, right up until they realize how necessary it is anyway. Honestly, the economics of fascism is strange and all over the place, frequently dependant on the current situation to figure out how they can best empower the leadership and suppress the people. It's arguable that fascism has no specific economic basis. So that's something. It's worth mentioning that the two primary fascist governments spoken of, WWII Italy and Germany, made heavy partnerships with big business, not unlike modern republicans.

Fascism tends to suppress women, prevent abortion of any they consider ""desirable"" and force death on any they consider ""undesirable"" (They haven't managed to gain enough control to do this yet in America, but they're trying). It also condemns those who don't fit their ""perfect"" person (the physically weak, LGBTQ, other races) which fits well with the republican anti-everything stance.

Ultranationalist you need look no further than the everpresent MAGA catchphrase and hyper-patriotic bullshit.

Fascism is totalitarian, trying to demonize and force out anyone who isn't of the right party. Again, democrats are demonized by republicans, and they'd be suppressing us and forcing us out if they could muster the support. As it is, they suppress and force out anyone on their side who doesn't toe the line, like Liz Cheney, ousted for admitting Trump lost and Biden won.

I could go on. Yes, the republican party, particularly under Donald John Trump, displays every imaginable sign of fascism.

Just because they haven't taken full control and are doing a shit job of it doesn't mean they aren't fascist.

Second copy-paste to reinforce the point: 

I can't speak for poli-sci or history scholarship in general, but Umberto Eco, a leading italian academic (who unfortunately passed recently) has written a great deal on fascism, and in his 1995 essay ""Ur-Fascism"" set forward some principles by which one can recognize fascism in the modern day, and they share a great deal in common with this list from the Holocaust Museum. In fact, he puts forward 14 as well:

1.The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

2.The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

3.The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

4.Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

5.Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

6.Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

7.The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

8.The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

9.Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

10.Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

11.Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

12.Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

13.Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

14.Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

I think ""fascism"" as an insult can be a little watered down, but...like, anyone can be called an ""asshole"" as well and that doesn't mean their aren't straight out-and-out assholes out there.

I prefer Umberto Eco's reflections on growing up in Fascist Italy through his essay Ur Fascism

https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf

He points out that, as an ideology, it is sort of malleable and Italian Fascism is different from Nazism, but there are concrete structures and themes.

And finally, a variety of links describing the actions of the republican party and the ties to fascism:

---

Thirteen Republican members of the House voted for the infrastructure bill now headed for President Biden’s desk. That may not sound like much, but given the intensity of G.O.P. partisanship — the loser in the New Jersey governor’s race still hasn’t conceded — getting even that many Republicans to back an initiative that might help Mr. Biden is amazing.

These votes suggest that politicians believe what polling indicates — that repairing roads and bridges, expanding broadband and more are immensely popular and that opposing the bill would be politically costly. (Six progressive Democrats voted against the legislation, but Nancy Pelosi, who said she had a “secret whip count,” might have been able to get some of those votes if she had needed them.)

But if infrastructure spending is a political winner, why didn’t it happen under Donald Trump? The Trump administration first declared Infrastructure Week in June 2017, but no legislative proposal ever materialized, and by the time Trump was voted out of office the phrase had become a national punchline. Why?

It wasn’t just incompetence, although that was part of it. The bigger story is that the modern Republican Party is constitutionally incapable — or maybe, given recent behavior, that should be unconstitutionally incapable — of investing in America’s future. And, sad to say, pro-corporate Democrats, whom we really should stop calling “centrists,” have some of the same problems.

Trump talked big about infrastructure during the 2016 election campaign. But the “plan” released by his advisers — it was actually just a vague sketch — was a mess. It wasn’t even really a proposal for public investment; to a large extent it was an exercise in crony capitalism, a scheme for taxpayer-subsidized private investment that would, like the “opportunity zones” that were part of the 2017 tax cut, mainly have ended up showering benefits on wealthy developers. It was also completely unworkable.

If Trump had wanted to get anything real accomplished, he would have had to turn to people who had some idea about what they were doing, who at least knew how to draft legislation. But he wasn’t willing to work with Democrats — and key Republicans in Congress, Mitch McConnell in particular, opposed significant infrastructure investment every step of the way.

Why this opposition? Much of it was ostensibly about how to pay for additional spending. Republicans were, of course, opposed to new taxes, especially on corporations and the wealthy; they also claimed to be against additional government borrowing.

But the first rule of deficit politics is that nobody really cares about deficits. Republicans certainly didn’t care when they rammed through a $1.9 trillion tax cut without any offsetting cost savings. The handful of Democrats still balking at Biden’s Build Back Better plan, which would invest in people in addition to steel and concrete, have held up a vote by demanding a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. But they don’t seem to mind the fact that the physical infrastructure bill is partly paid for with smoke and mirrors and that the C.B.O. estimates that it will add hundreds of billions to the deficit.

As it happens, many economists now believe that given low interest rates, we actually shouldn’t worry about deficits. But that doesn’t stop politicians from selectively invoking deficit fears as a way to block government programs they don’t like.

In the case of mainstream Republicans, that basically means opposing everything that isn’t military spending. Anything else is “socialism,” which on the right has come to mean spending money in any way that helps ordinary citizens.

Indeed, it’s fairly clear that what conservatives fear isn’t that new government programs will fail; they’re afraid that the programs will be perceived as successful and will help to legitimize an expanded role for government in addressing social problems.

That is, they worry that government programs that actually help people could turn us into a “nation of takers” — maybe even a nation that taxes the rich to pay for aid to those in need.

Given this attitude, the only way Trump could have gotten an infrastructure bill would have been to bypass much of his own party and work with Democrats. But as I said, he wasn’t willing to do that.

Sadly, the handful of Democrats who may yet kill Build Back Better seem to share Republican unwillingness to invest in the future, albeit in milder form. They’re willing to spend on infrastructure, even with borrowed money. But they get cold feet over social spending, even though there’s strong evidence that such spending would greatly help the economy (not to mention their own constituents). Why? Well, Joe Manchin says he’s worried about us becoming an “entitlement society.”

At this point, however, indulging this nonsense would have huge political as well as human costs. Biden’s ability to finally get the infrastructure bill that eluded Trump for four years is an object lesson in what can be achieved if we sideline the ideologues and crony capitalists. Now Democrats should finish the job.",2,[],[],['Donald Trump']

By the usual measures, the U.S. economy has been booming this year. Employment has risen by more than five million since January; a record number of Americans say this is a good time to find a quality job, a sentiment reflected in the willingness of an unprecedented number of workers to quit (yes, high quit rates are a good sign).

Yet Americans are, or say they are, pessimistic about the economic situation. For example, here’s the widely cited Michigan index of consumer sentiment, which has slid to a level not seen since the depths of the pandemic slump:

Image
Credit...University of Michigan

How can people be feeling so bad about a seemingly good economy?

One answer is that Americans are upset about inflation and disrupted supply chains. And that’s surely true. But I’d suggest that it’s only part of the story — that to an important extent, when you ask people about the state of the economy, their replies don’t necessarily reflect their actual experience. Instead, they respond based on what they imagine is happening to other people, a perception that can be shaped by news reports and their own political leanings.

That is, I’m suggesting that public views about the economy are a bit like public views on crime, which many people said was rising even when it was steadily falling.

OK, I don’t want to go all Phil Gramm here. For those who don’t get the reference, Gramm, a former congressman, was an adviser to John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign, and he made waves by dismissing concerns about the economy. We were, he insisted, only in a “mental recession” and had become a “nation of whiners.”

So for the record, inflation is indeed high by recent standards and supply-chain issues are real, although often overstated. (Retailers are hiring furiously for the holiday season, suggesting that they expect to have plenty to sell.)

Still, when you look into consumer surveys, you find that answers to the question “How is the economy doing?” don’t necessarily track with answers to the question “How are you doing?”

Here’s what the Michigan survey found when it asked people to compare their current financial situation with their situation five years ago; numbers greater than 100 mean improvement. That number has slid a bit since the beginning of this year, but it’s still quite high — in fact, as high as the average for 2019, when the Trump administration was boasting nonstop about the economy:

Image
Credit...University of Michigan

Other surveys find similar results. For example, Langer Research Associates breaks its Consumer Confidence Index into components; the number for “personal finances” is far higher than the number for “national economy”:

Image
Credit...Langer Research Associates

So Americans, while legitimately troubled by inflation, are feeling pretty good about their own financial situation; their downbeat economic assessment involves a belief that bad things are happening to other people. Where does that belief come from?

To some extent public perceptions may have been shaped by widespread media coverage of preliminary economic reports that suggested a struggling economy. After revisions, the data look much better — most notably, soft preliminary employment numbers for August and September received many headlines, while it’s a good bet that few Americans are aware of later revisions that added more than 200,000 jobs.

And some news organizations have been doing all they can to convey the impression of a troubled economy, whatever the reality. As I suggested, while supply-chain issues are real, their impact is often overstated; empty shelves are actually fairly rare. That, presumably, is why Fox News and Newsmax have been running segments about the Biden economy featuring photos of empty shelves that were taken last year or in other countries.

Which brings me to the effects of partisanship. Republicans and Democrats share the same economy, but their responses to surveys about that economy’s condition are very different. After Donald Trump’s still-not-acknowledged electoral defeat, Republicans turned hugely more negative on the economy, while Democrats turned somewhat more positive:

Image
Credit...University of Michigan

So why do Americans feel bad about a seemingly booming economy? Inflation and shortages of some goods are real issues, but much of the economic discontent seems to be based on news reports and partisan leanings, that is, it’s disconnected from personal experience.

This has important implications, among other things, for the politics of economic policy. The economy is likely to get considerably better over the months ahead as the pandemic subsides and snarls in the supply chain get worked out.

46578,2021-11-15 15:21:03,NBC News: Rep Adam Schiff: Steele Dossier conclusion of Russia assisting Trump 'turned out to be all too true',,2021-11-16 00:44:01,AmericanPolitics,t3_quirv6,"Significance of the Trump Tower Meeting

The June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort included at least eight people. So far acknowledged in attendance: Trump Jr., Kushner, Manafort, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya (who has admitted working as an agent for the Russian Government), Rinat Akhmetshin, and publicist Rob Goldstone, who helped set up the meeting. 

But there were at least two other people in the room as well, a translator and a representative of the Russian family who had asked Goldstone to set up the meeting. Akhmetshin is a registered lobbyist for Veselnitskaya's organization, which has focused on lobbying Washington to overturn the Magnitskiy sanctions (imposed on egregious human rights violators in Russia after human rights lawyer Sergey Magnitskiy was murdered), according to lobbying records. 

Akhmetshin has been described as a Russian immigrant to the United States who has been accused of acting as an unregistered agent for Russian interests and apparently has ties to Russian intelligence. Goldstone has bragged about past connections to Russian counterintelligence operations.

As for the significance of the Trump Tower meeting, the main takeaway for Russia was the confirmation that the Trump campaign was indeed interested in collusion (really, conspiracy is a better word) to get Trump elected by having Russia interfere in our election and provide negative information on Hillary Clinton. They got that with Don, Jr's expression, aloud and in an email, ""I love it"". 

After that, the Russians gave the go ahead to Julian Assange, their disinformation vehicle of choice, to have Wikileaks release the emails the Russians had given them by having GRU asset Guccifer2.0 hack the DNC and John Podesta's computers. From then on, to protect the Trump family, contact was only to be between Assange/Wikileaks and intermediaries such as Roger Stone and possibly Manafort.

Aside from reassurance that the Trump Campaign was interested in working with Russia to get Trump elected, what did Russia get out of this? The main Russian interest was, and remains, the removal of, or at least lessening of, the Magnitskiy Action sanctions and the sanctions imposed on Russia after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and launching of the war against Ukraine. (More sanctions were imposed later as a result of the Russian meddling in the election, but the first sanctions were imposed because of the Magnitskiy Act and Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.) 

In addition to whatever verbal commitments the Trump Campaign might have made, the Russians received concrete evidence of the Trump team’s willingness to comply with Russia’s goal to lessen and ultimately remove the sanctions when the plank on Ukraine in the Republican national platform was weakened during the Republican National Convention. Manafort was Trump’s campaign chairman at the time and the weakening of the Ukraine plank was his doing. This was the beginning of the quo the Russians expected in the quid pro quo equation for their help to the Trump Campaign.

---

For centuries, America has invested taxpayer money in its future. Public funds built physical infrastructure, from the Erie Canal to the interstate highway system. We invested in human capital, too: Universal education came to the United States early, and America basically invented modern public secondary education. This public spending laid the foundations for prosperity and helped make us an economic superpower.

With the rise of the modern right, however, America turned its back on that history. Tax breaks — essentially giving wealthy people money and hoping that it would trickle down — became the solution to every problem. “Infrastructure week” became a punchline under Donald Trump partly because the Trump team’s proposals were more about crony capitalism than about investment, partly because Trump never showed the will to override conservatives who opposed any significant new spending.

Now Joe Biden is trying to revive the tradition of public spending oriented toward the future.

The Build Back Better legislation that passed the House last week isn’t a pure investment plan; in particular, it includes substantial health care spending that is more about helping Americans in the near term than about the future. But about two-thirds of the proposed spending is indeed investment in the sense that it should have big payoffs in the future. And if you combine Build Back Better with the already-enacted infrastructure bill, you see an agenda that is about three-fourths investment spending.

Here’s how I read the Biden program as it now stands. Total new spending would be about $2.3 trillion over a decade. This total would include $500 billion to $600 billion of spending on each of three things: traditional infrastructure, restructuring the economy to address climate change, and children, with the last item mainly consisting of pre-K and child care but also involving tax credits that would greatly reduce child poverty.

There’s every reason to believe that all three types of spending would have a high social rate of return.

Snarled supply chains have reminded everyone that old-fashioned physical infrastructure remains hugely important; we are still living in a material world, and getting stuff where it needs to go requires public as well as private investment.

As far as climate investments are concerned, the damage from a warming planet is becoming increasingly obvious — and droughts, fires and extreme weather are only the leading edge of the disasters to come. Build Back Better’s investments wouldn’t come close to ending the danger, but they would mitigate climate change, partly protect us against some its consequences and make it easier for the United States to lead the world toward a more comprehensive solution. So the money would be well spent.

Finally, there is overwhelming evidence that helping families with children is a high-return investment in the nation’s future, because children whose families have adequate resources become healthier, more productive adults.

So what’s not to like about this agenda? No, it wouldn’t be inflationary: Don’t take it from me, listen to credit rating agencies, which are saying the same thing. The approved and proposed spending would be fairly small as a share of gross domestic product — which the Congressional Budget Office projects at $288 trillion over the next decade — and largely paid for with new taxes, so it would have very little inflationary impact.

Oh, and while some of the “pay-fors” are questionable — as it happens, mainly on the traditional infrastructure bill; Build Back Better is more or less paid for — which means that the spending would probably add somewhat to federal debt over the next few years, that debt increase would be small relative to G.D.P. and, given low interest rates, would barely add to debt service costs. Over the longer term, the payoff to public investment might well be enough to reduce the deficit.

Still, Republicans are denouncing the Biden agenda as socialism, because, of course, they are. Hey, by their standards America has been run by socialists for most of its history — people like DeWitt Clinton, the New York governor who built the Erie Canal, and Horace Mann, who led the Common School movement for universal basic education a couple of decades later. And don’t even get me started on Dwight Eisenhower, who presided over huge government investment and a top tax rate of 91 percent.

Admittedly, the Biden plan would reduce economic disparities, both because expanded benefits would matter more to less-affluent families and because its tax changes would be strongly progressive. But public policy that reduces inequality, like public investment, is squarely in our national tradition. America basically invented progressive taxation, and as the economist Claudia Goldin has noted, the high school movement was “rooted in egalitarianism.”

So don’t believe politicians who are trying to portray Biden’s investment agenda as somehow irresponsible and radical. It’s highly responsible, and it’s an attempt to restore the all-American idea that government should help create a better future.",1,[],[],"['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']"

---

An earlier version of this post misstated that Seth Rich was a Hillary Clinton campaign staffer.

Listen to political scientists, pollsters and well-meaning elected officials, and you’ll likely hear a lot of chatter about “polarization.” That characterization of our current political environment misses the point — and is dangerous.

You know the argument: America is divided into warring camps. The center has collapsed. Compromise is impossible. We have become uncivil and angry.

While it’s true that the country is more deeply divided along partisan lines than it has been in the past, it is wrong to suggest a symmetrical devolution into irrational hatred. The polarization argument too often treats both sides as equally worthy of blame, characterizing the problem as a sort of free-floating affliction (e.g., “lack of trust”). This blurs the distinction between a Democratic Party that is marginally more progressive in policy positions than it was a decade ago, and a Republican Party that routinely lies, courts violence and seeks to define America as a White Christian nation.

The Republican Party’s tolerance of violence is not matched by Democrats. Nor is the Republican Party’s refusal to recognize the sanctity of elections. Democrats did not call the elections they lost in 2020 and 2021 “rigged,” nor are they seeking to replace nonpartisan election officials with partisan lawmakers. Republicans’ determination to change voting laws based on their insistence that Donald Trump won the 2020 election is without historical precedent.
As chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, Clint Hickman defended the integrity of the 2020 election, even though he was a Trump supporter. (Erin Patrick O'Connor, Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post)

The GOP’s willingness to force a default on the debt is likewise indicative of a party that has fallen into nihilism. And Republicans’ refusal to give a sitting president’s Supreme Court nominee a hearing followed by the effort to push through a nominee of their own party during an election shows the party lacks any modicum of restraint and respect for institutions.

Only one party conducts fake election audits, habitually relies on conspiracy theories and wants to limit access to the ballot. A recent study from the libertarian think tank R Street found: “In Republican states, legislation tended to scale back the availability of mail-in voting and ballot drop boxes and to provide more uniform, if not shorter, early voting windows. Meanwhile, in Democratic states, legislators sought to increase the availability of early voting not only by expanded voting windows but also by instating universal vote-by-mail.”

Only one party overwhelmingly refused to participate in a bipartisan investigation of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Only one party tolerates and defends House members who resort to violent imagery and harass fellow lawmakers. Talk of “secession” comes from only one party. Only one party is turning a vigilante who killed two people and seriously injured another into a folk hero. Only one party rises in defense of parents publicly threatening school boards. Only one party has taken to defending book-banning and book-burning. Governors of only one party are suing private companies and localities that follow coronavirus guidelines.

Only one party has a media machine that propagates misinformation (from conspiracy theories about the death of a young Democratic National Committee staffer to the blatant lies about Dominion Voting Systems) and foments racism with a steady diet of “replacement theory” rants and hyperventilation about immigrants. Only one party pounds away at the already debunked connection between crime and immigrants solely for the purpose of enraging and scaring voters.

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) had it almost right when she wrote in May, “The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution.” The GOP has already decided. The answer is no.

When it comes to compromise, only one party refused to cast a single vote in favor of the American Rescue Plan. Only one party in the Senate (minus a lone Alaska Republican) categorically refuses to debate voting reform or to consider reauthorizing Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

Take any issue, and one can see the difference between mutual polarization and radicalization. It is not merely that Republicans want to restrict abortions; they dangle bounties for those who aid women who seek abortions after six weeks of pregnancy (roughly 85 percent of all abortions) and attempt to shield the legislation from judicial review.

Likewise, Republicans do not merely object to significant tax increases on the super rich and corporations; they reject any tax changes that would force them to pay something in taxes and refuse to adequately fund the Internal Revenue Service to collect taxes already owed.

At the other end of the spectrum, when a few Democrats and advocates started calling to “defund the police,” President Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and a slew of other Democratic leaders put the kibosh on such talk.

The “polarization” decriers cop out when describing the country in terms that suggest both sides are to blame. Honesty compels us to recognize that while progressives might have more ambitious goals for government, they work within the democratic structure and acknowledge reality. The same cannot be said of Republicans. Let’s face it: We would not have a democracy crisis and an epistemological crisis if not for the Republican Party.",8,[],[],['Donald Trump']

He's trying to force companies into triple vaxx policies, even though the courts have repeatedly found this to be unconstitutional. 

He's also attacking free speech. He's turned a blind eye to tech monopolies colluding and violating anti-trust laws to push the agenda of a single political party while banning dissenting ideas.

---

Numerous investigations and reports have produced substantial evidence of probable cause that Trump and his operatives violated at least one criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 241. That statute makes it a federal crime for “two or more persons” to conspire to prevent anyone from exercising or enjoying any right or privilege secured by the Constitution or laws of the U.S., and it makes such crime punishable by fine, or imprisonment up to ten years.

The Supreme Court has stressed that Section 241 contains “sweeping general words” and directed courts to give the provision “a sweep as broad as its language.” In United States v. Classic it established that the statute protects not only the right to vote but the right to have one’s vote properly counted. Classic upheld an indictment of officials who sought to aid one candidate by refusing to count votes cast for his opponent.

The broad language of Section 241 clearly encompasses the actions of those involved in Trump’s coup attempt, and the Court’s precedents support that conclusion. Evidence currently available shows that the conspirators agreed to a common scheme to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election, took innumerable acts designed to accomplish that goal, and intended thereby to effectively deprive millions of voters in half a dozen states—and the rest of the 81 million Americans who voted for Joe Biden—of their right to vote and have their votes properly counted.

In Anderson v. U.S. the Court explicitly held that Section 241 reaches conspiracies designed “to dilute the value of votes of qualified voters.” It requires only an intent to prevent votes from being “given full value and effect,” an intent that includes an intent “to have false votes cast.” Evidence suggests that Trump and his supporters attempted exactly that in Georgia. They pressured local officials to somehow, some way magically “find” 11,780 additional votes to give Trump victory there and negate the votes of nearly two and a half million Georgia voters.",6,[],[],['Joe Biden']

---



Donald Trump ventured into the safe confines of Sean Hannity’s show on Tuesday night, where he disclosed that Kyle Rittenhouse had visited him at Mar-a-Lago. “Really a nice young man,” the former president declared.

This led some outraged observers to decry the “sickness” at the core of the Trumpified GOP. But what came next is more troubling — and more revealing about the Trump movement’s darker impulses.

“He should not have had to suffer through a trial,” Trump said, suggesting Rittenhouse had almost been killed by one of his victims and had rightly killed first. “He should never have been put through that.”

In the days after Rittenhouse, 18, was acquitted of homicide in killing two and wounding a third amid unrest in Kenosha, Wis., two strains of Rittenhouse lionization developed on the right. One was sanitized, mainly treating his acquittal as heroic in that he evaded a would-be injustice at the hands of out-of-control leftism.

The other was darker and more explicit, treating Rittenhouse as a hero for what he did: cross state lines to deliberately place himself in a combustible situation, armed to kill, in a manner likely to provoke the fighting — and lead to the killing — that did indeed take place.

Trump has in effect aligned his movement squarely with the second strain: Rittenhouse’s conduct should never have been subjected to scrutiny by a jury of his peers in the first place; Rittenhouse is the one who meted out justice; his killing in a highly confusing situation should properly have been placed all along outside the procedural realm we describe as the “rule of law.”

As president in August 2020 just after the killing, Trump was already suggesting Rittenhouse had properly acted in self-defense. But it’s highly notable that Trump is now declaring he never should have stood trial after his acquittal.

Here was an opportunity for Trump to declare that the justice system had — by his lights at least — worked amid searing passions and political turbulence unleashed by the saga. Instead, he suggested that the very fact that Rittenhouse’s conduct underwent scrutiny itself constituted an injustice, and itself discredited our legal system.

Which is the whole point: To reinforce the idea that Rittenhouse’s conduct — not just the killing, but the conduct that led up to and ultimately precipitated it — should never have been subjected to legal scrutiny at all, that it properly occurred outside the realm of the rule of law.
On Nov. 21, lawmakers and activists responded to Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal for the fatal shootings of racial justice protesters in 2020. (The Washington Post)

Of course, this doesn’t morally exonerate Rittenhouse of the dangerously provocative conduct leading up to this. And as James Hohmann notes, there were reasonable grounds for thinking he went into the situation with the express purpose of meting out vigilante violence or worse. Whether he did this was an important legal question, but his lawyers (and the judge’s rulings) managed to obscure it.

Yet Trump is not obscuring it. He’s bringing it out into sharper relief.

In Trump’s telling, the very act of apparently seeking to dispense vigilante justice — and thus provoking a situation that led to the killing — amid violence connected to racial justice protests is precisely what should never have been subjected to rule-of-law scrutiny.

Let’s not forget that before this saga, right-wing media had whipped up an atmosphere that seemed certain to encourage vigilante conduct by madly hyping protests and unrest to feed impressions that leftists were pushing the country into full-scale civil collapse.

And now, needless to say, Trump isn’t taking this opportunity to say this was a horrible tragedy involving an impressionable teen who should never have placed himself in that situation (but nonetheless one our justice system dealt with adequately).

Instead, for Trump, the story is that Rittenhouse’s conduct was good and admirable.

Many on the right have been explicit about this. As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp documents, they have hailed Rittenhouse’s decision to put himself in that situation as itself constituting an act of noble, selfless heroism. The fake-justification for this — as always — is that the left required it.

“By suggesting he is a hero,” political scientist Lilliana Mason told Beauchamp, “the implication is that what he did was not a tragedy at all. It wasn’t a conflict gone lethally wrong, it was a good lethal conflict.”

That bodes badly for what’s to come, especially now that Trump has effectively endorsed this view.

Writing at the Atlantic, Adam Serwer connects this tendency to elements of right-wing gun culture that rely on constant invocations of leftist tyranny to inspire and justify preparation for armed resistance to it. The backdrop is the construction of a “legal regime” in which Americans are liberated to settle differences themselves with the foot soldiers of leftist tyranny “with lethal force.”

The final piece of this puzzle is to suggest evaluation of this killing should have been taken out of the realm of rule of law entirely. For Trump, the injustice that occurred here is that Rittenhouse’s conduct was subjected to structured, procedural evaluation within a realm of authority whose enforcement power derives from democratic decision-making.

That’s bad enough coming from an unhinged Fox News personality or a far-right Internet fringe lurker. But this is coming from the former president of the United States — and a likely future candidate for that office, as well.",5,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---

Bob Dole, the former Senate majority leader and presidential candidate, died on Sunday at age 98. The media were filled with encomiums, which was understandable even for those who opposed much of what he stood for.

It’s not just that he was a war hero, or that he reminds us of an era in which the two parties were willing to work together in the national interest. His life story also reminds us of a time when public figures were supposed to show some sense of responsibility — to possess basic decency, to admit to mistakes when they made them, even to put their lives on the line in time of war. Human nature being what it is, many people who pretended to have these virtues were hypocrites. But at least that was the ideal, and being an obvious crook, liar or coward was politically disqualifying.

Not anymore.

As it happens, Dole’s death came just a few days after we learned what Donald Trump did after he tested positive for the coronavirus last year. He not only concealed the result but also proceeded to put hundreds of people at risk by continuing his normal activities while refusing to wear a mask or practice social distancing. And when he came down with a life-threatening case of Covid, he suggested that he might have caught it from Gold Star families he had met with after his positive test — that is, he blamed people he himself had callously endangered.

At some level, nobody is surprised; we knew that Trump was malignant to a degree never before seen in high office. But what does it say about the state of modern America that nobody expects him to pay any price for this revelation? The loyalty of his base won’t be shaken; he’s still the favorite for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

Nor has he paid any price for other character defects that would once have been considered damning. A generation or two ago, could a national political figure have gotten away with being constantly self-pitying, complaining about how badly he’s being treated? Could he have paid no penalty for always refusing to admit error, even if the cover-up required altering weather maps with what appears to have been a Sharpie?

And Trump seems to have set the standard for many of his devotees. Many of the rioters who tried to overturn the election on Jan. 6 seem to be very sorry — for themselves. Kyle Rittenhouse wept on the witness stand, not because he felt remorse over killing people but over the pain of being put on trial. The Crumbleys, who gave their son the gun with which he shot up his Michigan school and killed four students, also seemed very upset — over having been arrested.

All this from a movement obsessed with the idea of masculinity. Weren’t real men traditionally supposed to be strong, silent types who took responsibility for their actions and accepted burdens without complaining? Of course, these are human virtues, not specifically masculine; still, they used to be qualities we expected and admired.

It didn’t start with Trump. We’ve been heading this way for a long time. Back in 2006, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq on false pretenses and the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, I wrote about the “mensch gap” — the unwillingness of the people then running the country to accept responsibility for their own failures, their eagerness to blame others when things went wrong. Later, during the Obama era, it was striking how many critics on the right refused to acknowledge error when their predictions of runaway inflation or the abject failure of Obamacare failed to come true.

But now the transformation of American conservatism — the same movement that complains about liberal “snowflakes” — into a collection of malignant whiners seems to have reached apotheosis. Yes, there are self-pitying hypocrites on the left too; but they don’t dominate the way Trump and Trump-like figures dominate the right.",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---



Given the realities of 21st century American politics, it would never have been possible for us to experience a pandemic that existed outside politics. But it’s hard to imagine how this one could have been more political. And it may be about to get worse.

The omicron variant of covid-19 has begun to spread rapidly through the country, and we will see it everywhere. But this could be the red covid wave, inflicting the most damage on heavily Republican areas.

There will be a great temptation for liberals to say “serves you right” to conservatives. Understandable as that might be, we should all try to resist the urge to take even a moment’s satisfaction in anyone’s suffering.

There’s no way to know how this wave will proceed, but there has been a clear pattern so far. The initial wave of the pandemic hit hardest in dense, heavily Democratic areas, most notably New York and New Jersey. That helped lock in the politicization of the virus, as conservatives felt like it wasn’t affecting their communities, and Republican politicians and media figures told them it was overblown and public health measures represented liberal tyranny.

By the time we got to the delta wave, we were long past the point where people would see anything about the pandemic in nonpolitical terms. Everything about it was spun through a media system built for turning disagreements into markers of partisan identity, so that to approach any issue in a way different from your partisan brethren would be to betray a foundational part of your identity.

And don’t even get me started on Fox News — the beating heart of the conservative universe — which has been an absolute sewer of anti-vaccine propaganda, advocacy for quack cures and conspiracy theorizing.

Though delta began affecting liberal and conservative areas in equal measure, it quickly became more and more a red-area phenomenon. As Charles Gaba documents, in September, the worst month for delta, the rate of covid deaths in the reddest 10 percent of counties (measured by presidential vote in 2020) was nearly seven times higher than the rate in the bluest 10 percent of counties.

In the months since, that ratio has stayed shockingly high; so far in December, it is nearly 6 to 1.

What will happen when omicron reaches every corner of America? First note that Democrats are far more likely to have been vaccinated. In a recent Monmouth University poll, 96 percent of Democrats said they had been vaccinated, compared to 54 percent of Republicans. And 30 percent of Republicans said they will likely never get vaccinated.

Granting that we don’t yet know exactly how omicron will proceed, it will almost certainly find more purchase where fewer people are vaccinated and take few precautions. Which would mean that the red/blue disparity could intensify. Yet it’s unlikely people in those heavily red areas will suddenly say, “Gee, we really need to take this seriously.”

Instead, we’ll see a continuation of what we’ve seen all along: governments and businesses in blue areas reacting to this outbreak with somewhat aggressive public health measures, while governments and businesses in red areas make a point of doing nothing.

Even now, we’re averaging 1,275 covid deaths a day. If and when it rises to 2,000 or 3,000 — disproportionately from red states and counties — there will inevitably be more of the schadenfreude we’ve already seen on the left.

Some of this is just the momentary nastiness all of us are prey to. But much of it comes from the feeling among liberals that while we’ve done everything possible to shorten this pandemic, conservatives have almost gleefully endeavored to extend it and ensure that as many people as possible get sick and die.

We’re all angry and fed up. We all wish this was over. Rightly or wrongly, many liberals assign part of the blame for our continued misery to the right, both the cynical elites who discourage vaccination, and the rank and file who want nothing more than to “own the libs,” even if it means putting themselves and their families at risk.

But what is there to gain from giving in to the impulse to shout that if their communities are laid low by omicron, they brought it on themselves?

To be clear, I’m not offering a “when they go low, we go high” recommendation on what effective political strategy might be. But I can’t help but think about how Donald Trump so often told Americans to cultivate what was worst in them, and to luxuriate in their bigotries, their resentments, their rage and their hate.

It was poison, and it still runs through our bloodstream. But we don’t all have to be that way. We can speak the truth about where we are without wishing death on our political opponents. We can fight for what we believe in without twisting into the ugliest version of ourselves.

So the next time you hear a story about another anti-vax right-wing radio host or televangelist who died from covid, rather than chuckling, think of those they put at risk, the gullible or distracted people more likely to become infected because of them, and the ripples of loss spreading from them.

That’s not to excuse the villains of this pandemic. They deserve our anger and condemnation. But after two years of misery and sorrow, a new wave of death and disease is nothing to feel satisfaction about, no matter whom it hits hardest.",4,[],[],['Donald Trump']

Similarly, Bernie Sanders kind of uses the Democratic Party as a show of power when he won’t back down from the nomination and he clearly knows it’s over.

&gt; Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John Hannah said he would impose a $50,000 fine against Cyber Ninjas every day until it hands over documents related to the so-called audit after the Arizona Republic newspaper filed a public records request, The Associated Press reported Thursday.

&gt; State Senate Republicans hired Cyber Ninjas to conduct an election audit of ballots in Maricopa County, the state&amp;#039;s most populous county, after Biden flipped the state to blue for the first time in decades - beating former President Donald Trump by more than 10,400 votes.

50542,2022-01-07 13:47:41,Biden is quietly erasing one of Trump’s cruelest legacies,,2022-01-07 13:59:46,AmericanPolitics,t3_ry7qvi,"&gt;It has been overshadowed by months of Democratic infighting and the searing national debate over Jan. 6, but the Biden administration is quietly erasing one of the cruelest legacies of Donald Trump’s presidency. This is a genuine achievement, in both symbolic and practical terms.**On Thursday, the administration rejected Georgia’s proposal to impose work requirements and premiums on Medicaid recipients. This was effectively the last nail in the coffin of Trump’s zombie attempt to make Medicaid more cumbersome and bureaucratic, in hopes of knocking as many people off health coverage as possible**.  
&gt;  
&gt;When Biden took office, nearly 20 mostly Republican-controlled states were in the process of crafting work requirements for Medicaid, on which 76 million Americans rely.Now, Medicaid work requirements are all but dead in all those states.That erases a legacy of the Trump administration, which had invited states to submit proposals to impose such requirements. Proposals were eventually approved for 12 states — all with Republican legislatures, governors or both — while a half-dozen others were pending when Trump left office.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the most visible case, under Arkansas’s 2018 requirements, nearly 17,000 people lost health coverage. That wasn’t necessarily because they weren’t working. It was mainly because it was so difficult to satisfy all the reporting requirements.  
&gt;  
&gt;Which is a feature, not a bug, of work requirements. By forcing recipients to prove they’re working and navigate a bureaucratic maze to stay in the program, the state gives itself an excuse to kick off those who make a paperwork mistake or miss a reporting deadline.Biden’s reversal began just after he took office. In February, the administration informed states that it was preparing to withdraw approvals for work requirements granted under Trump.  
&gt;  
&gt;One by one over the following months, those approvals were either rescinded by the administration, held up by court challenges, or delayed by state governments that expected the policy reversal (in Utah, officials suspended requirements due to the pandemic). Georgia was the last state where approval for this policy was still in force, though Republican states may still wage court battles.  
&gt;  
&gt;Legacy of cruelty 
&gt;
&gt;Trump’s effort to impose Medicaid work requirements was part of a much larger campaign to undermine and roll back our country’s fitful advance toward universal health care. This constituted an even broader legacy of cruelty, and arguably outright betrayal.That’s because Trump campaigned in 2016 as a corrective to Paul Ryan-style Republicans who had treated destroying the social safety net as a quasi-religious calling. Trump vowed that “everybody’s got to be covered,” and insisted no one would die on the street, uninsured.  
&gt;  
&gt;But once in office, Trump embraced GOP anti-safety-net zealotry by going all in on the Republican effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Driven by hatred of Barack Obama, he endlessly raged that the ACA was a “disaster.”  
&gt;  
&gt;That culminated in the 2017 repeal attempt, which fortunately failed. Stymied in that effort, which would have taken coverage away from millions on the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, Trump sought to weaken the safety net via other administrative means, such as these Medicaid work requirements.And so, in erasing those requirements, Biden is also erasing a larger hangover of Trumpian cruelty.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ACA is expanding 
&gt;
&gt;This legacy is being erased in another way. Under Biden, the same ACA that Trump tried to destroy is expanding and moving toward realizing its potential. A record number of more than 13 million people have signed up for 2022 coverage on the exchanges.A key reason for this is that the covid-19 rescue plan that Biden signed in March expanded the number of people eligible for ACA subsidies and beefed up subsidies for those already eligible. As Margot Sanger-Katz details in the New York Times, this is a real achievement: It substantially reimagines and expands the ACA amid a pandemic, meaning the ACA is rising to an emergency occasion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, this achievement is at risk. The ACA expansion in the rescue package expires at the end of next year, and while Democrats want to extend it in the Build Back Better bill, a certain West Virginia senator remains opposed. That would be a policy and political disaster for Democrats.  
&gt;  
&gt;“If Democrats aren’t able to extend it, millions of people will get notice of huge premium increases right before the midterm election,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Making progress 
&gt;
&gt;In short, the pandemic has not dimmed the GOP desire to roll back that ACA expansion and undermine Medicaid, even as we face a new covid surge. But now, with the Georgia decision, work requirements are effectively dead — as long as a Democrat remains in the White House.Biden has made serious mistakes with the pandemic, in particular the failure to secure enough covid tests when need has exploded. But he’s making progress in getting more Americans covered, replacing the Trumpian impulse to impose suffering for the sin of being poor with the principle that every American ought to have access to health care.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Biden has quietly been moving us closer to universal coverage, picking up on a cause Democrats have been pursuing since the early 20th Century,” Jonathan Cohn, author of an excellent history of the ACA, told us. “A big part of that has been undoing the legacy of Trump.”",18,[],[],"['Barack Obama', 'Donald Trump']"

---



If Republicans succeed in blocking Democratic efforts to protect voting rights this week, as expected, the push to defend democracy will be anything but dead. That’s because another important proposal to prevent a stolen 2024 election is coming together in the Senate.

This one may — may — prove harder for Republicans to oppose. At least it should prove harder. It would help prevent a rerun of Donald Trump’s 2020 effort — and the violence that followed — with minimal reforms that Republicans can’t manufacture objections to as easily.

Senators are close to completing a bill to revise the Electoral Count Act of 1887, I’m told. The measure would fix ambiguities in the ECA that Trump directly exploited with his wide-ranging 2020 plot.

“This is a clear and present threat to democracy,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who is spearheading the bill, told me.

In coming weeks, it will be introduced by King and others, including Sens. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). This will be well after the voting rights debate, so it doesn’t defuse energy toward that paramount goal.

“It’s very important to emphasize that this is not a solution to the voting rights issues being raised across the country,” King said of the bill.

The bill seeks to block every pathway to a subverted election that Trump’s corruption exposed. There are three main ones. First, Trump pressured GOP state legislatures to appoint rogue presidential electors in defiance of state popular votes.

Second, Trump got dozens of congressional Republicans to try to invalidate electors legitimately appointed by swing states. Third, Trump pressed his vice president to abuse his largely ceremonial role to declare legitimate electors invalid.

Blocking these pathways raises a thorny problem. The drafters of the bill want to make it harder for members of Congress to invalidate — based on false claims of election fraud — a legitimate slate of electors from a state.

But they want to accomplish this without making it harder for Congress to invalidate a phony slate appointed by a rogue legislature and/or governor.

Here’s the solution they hit upon, according to King’s office.

Under the current ECA, it takes only a single member from each chamber to object to a slate of electors. After this, a majority in each chamber must sustain the objection to ensure those electors don’t get counted.

So the new bill would require a much larger bloc of members in each chamber to initiate an objection; drafters may set this at one-third. It would also require a supermajority in each chamber to sustain the objection; drafters may set this at three-fifths.

So if, say, Republicans in Congress simply refused to count a slate of legitimate electors for the Democratic candidate, they would need supermajorities to pull it off.

But what if a GOP-controlled state legislature and/or governor appointed fake electors in defiance of the voting? Under the current ECA, a GOP-controlled House and Senate could overrule any Democratic objection and theoretically count those electors.

So the bill creates backstops. First, it seeks to create a procedure for judicial review when a state government fails to follow its own lawful, preexisting procedures in appointing electors (in all states, this process is tied to the popular vote).

Second, the bill directs Congress to count the electors validated by the court and not the phony ones appointed by a state legislature and/or governor in that situation.

“The key point is that the state can’t change the rules after the election,” King told me. All of this reduces Congress’s role to the largely ceremonial counting of electors.

Finally, the bill clarifies the vice president’s role to unequivocally remove any power to make any decree about whether electors will be counted.

This would help “Trump-proof” future presidential elections, making it harder to pull off precisely the scheme Trump attempted after the 2020 vote.

It’s crucial to stress that ECA ambiguities undoubtedly helped spark Jan. 6. The very idea that the ECA left open these avenues helped inspire rioters to attack the Capitol, to pressure lawmakers and Trump’s vice president to exploit them.

Will 10 Republican senators support these reforms? They are not liable to typical GOP objections to democratic protections, such as the (phony) arguments that they aren’t needed or constitute the federal government trampling on states.

This would merely revise an existing statute to make it even less likely that Trump (or an imitator) would successfully pressure Republicans to carry out the same scheme again. Which would make it less likely to be attempted at all.

Isn’t that something Republicans want? Maybe. Punchbowl News reports that four GOP senators — Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi — have been generally discussing ECA reform.

But this may be a bait and switch, designed to make it easier for Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) to refuse to suspend the filibuster to protect voting rights by invoking the promise of bipartisan reform later. Once voting rights crashes, Republicans might suddenly lose interest in ECA reform.

But King said he’s determined to try to win Republicans. “I can’t count 10 Republicans right now, but I don’t think it’s unlikely,” King told me. “I see this as more of a bipartisan issue.”

If not, will Manchin and Sinema oppose a filibuster carve-out for even this no-brainer of a reform to avert a stolen 2024? We may soon find out.",6,[],[],['Donald Trump']

Do you remember Donald Trump’s trade war? You can be forgiven for having forgotten all about it, given everything that has happened since; it sounds trivial compared with his effort to stay in power by overturning a fair election. Even in terms of policy while in office, it was far less important than his pandemic denial, and probably less important than his tax cuts or his sabotage of health care.

But the trade war was uniquely Trumpian. His other policy actions were standard-issue Republicanism, but the rest of his party didn’t share his obsession with trade deficits; indeed, he probably wouldn’t have been able to do much on that front except for the fact that U.S. law gives presidents enormous discretion when setting tariffs. Only Trump really considered trade deficits an important issue; and he, er, trumpeted what he called a “historic trade deal” under which China agreed to buy an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods and services by the end of 2021.

Now, Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who has been the go-to source on the trade war from the beginning, has a final assessment of that deal. And it turns out to have been a complete flop: “China bought none of the additional $200 billion of exports Trump’s deal had promised.”

So Trump was a chump; the Chinese took him to the cleaners. But if you want to do a post-mortem on the trade war, Trump’s haplessness in dealing with foreign leaders is actually a minor part of the story. Far more important is the fact that the shocks we’ve been experiencing since the pandemic began make the Trumpian view of trade look even more economically foolish than it did when he took office.

In the world according to Trump and Peter Navarro, the man he chose as his trade czar, international trade is a zero-sum game. If other countries buy stuff from America, we win; if we buy stuff made abroad, we lose. Navarro and Wilbur Ross, Trump’s commerce secretary (he really knew how to pick them), made this explicit in a policy paper they put out during the 2016 campaign, which asserted that the trade deficit subtracts one-for-one from U.S. growth: Every dollar we spend on imports reduces our G.D.P. by a dollar.

Economists scoffed at this crude mercantilism, which completely ignored the point that imports can make us richer, because the whole reason we buy some goods from abroad is that they are cheaper and/or better than domestically produced alternatives. This is especially true in the modern world economy, where many products that enter international trade are “intermediate goods,” like parts that are used in production. As it turned out, Trump’s tariffs disproportionately affected intermediate goods. So the tariffs raised U.S. production costs and, according to almost all estimates, reduced the number of manufacturing jobs.

Still, mercantilism isn’t always unadulterated nonsense. (Sometimes it’s adulterated nonsense?) Under certain conditions — namely, when the economy is depressed because overall demand is inadequate — trade deficits can reduce output and jobs, and actions to reduce those deficits can act as a form of economic stimulus. That’s why, back in 2010, when lack of demand was the overriding constraint on the U.S. economy, I called for strong pressure on China to end the undervaluation of its currency.

And it’s possible that one of these years we will once again find ourselves facing persistent problems of inadequate demand. But that’s not where we are now.

We are, instead, currently living in a world of constrained supply — a world, in particular, in which domestic factories are struggling to produce what consumers want. Those supply constraints are why inflation has surged.

As we have entered this world, the United States has plunged deeper into trade deficit:

How should we think about this plunge? Would we be richer and better off if we didn’t allow as many imports?

The answer should be an obvious “no.” As many economists have pointed out, the pandemic has caused consumers, still nervous about face-to-face interaction, to switch from buying services to buying goods:

Imports have surged because many of the goods consumers want are produced abroad, and America doesn’t have the capacity to produce them here — at least not on short notice. Furthermore, even when we can satisfy demand with domestic production, that production, the tariff debacle tells us, often requires imported intermediate goods.

So if we had tried to block the pandemic-related import surge, we wouldn’t have had more jobs; we would just have had more shortages and even higher inflation. In fact, some economists have urged President Biden to help the fight against inflation by lifting the Trump tariffs — something he could do without congressional approval.

Unfortunately, it’s easy to see the political and strategic problems with doing this, no matter how much sense it would make. Trump may have been China’s chump, but Republicans would pounce on any action that could be construed as a gift to China, even if continuing Trump’s tariffs hurts us more than it hurts the Chinese government.

I’ve called today’s newsletter a post-mortem on Trump’s trade war, but, in fact, that trade war isn’t over. Trump’s trade policies were foolish and costly — they failed by any measure you choose — but it may be a long time before any president is in a position to undo the damage.",3,[],[],['Donald Trump']

 The Biden administration on Thursday proposed reversing a rule that denies green cards to applicants who receive certain government benefits, one of former President Donald Trump’s signature moves to limit legal immigration.  
  
The administration stopped applying the more expansive Trump-era limits in March, making the announcement more of a formality to insulate it from legal challenges. Its publication in the Federal Register in the coming days will trigger a 60-day period for public comment, followed by a final version.  
  
While the proposal has no immediate impact, it is an important step toward undoing Trump’s version of the “public charge” rule, as President Joe Biden promised during his campaign.  
  
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the Trump rule was “not consistent with our nation’s values.”  
  
“Under this proposed rule, we will return to the historical understanding of the term ‘public charge’ and individuals will not be penalized for choosing to access the health benefits and other supplemental government services available to them,” Mayorkas said in a statement.  
  
The Biden administration’s revisions largely restore rules that had been in place since 1999, which, among other things, do not consider use of noncash benefits like food stamps, health services and transportation vouchers when determining green-card eligibility.  
  
Trump made his intentions clear during his first year in office, but the rule didn’t take until 2020 due largely to legal challenges and procedural requirements. Still, Homeland Security said Thursday that it had “chilling effects” by causing people to quit or decline to enroll for benefits they were eligible to receive, fearing their applications to become legal permanent residents could be derailed.",1,[],[],"['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']"

More than a decade ago, the commentator Jonathan Chait wrote about the “hack gap,” a striking difference between the behavior of Republican and Democratic experts (or in some cases, “experts”) when their party controls the government. Republican experts slavishly praise their leaders, no matter what they do; Democratic experts strive for objectivity and, if anything, bend over backward to criticize their own side.

This happens in many areas; Chait was talking about legal analysis, but I see it all the time in my home field.

During the Trump years, Republican economists, even those you might have expected to be concerned about their professional reputations, rushed to embrace extravagant and implausible claims about what Donald Trump’s tax cuts would achieve. Some were even willing to abase themselves in ways reminiscent of Putin cronies. Remember when Tomas Philipson of the University of Chicago declared that Trump had economic instincts “on par with many Nobel economists I have worked with”?

Democratic economists, by contrast, often seem eager to display their independence by criticizing Biden administration policies. And while intellectual integrity is a good thing, I’d argue that sometimes the desire to seem independent leads Democratic economists to overdo it — to criticize arguments or policy proposals that actually make sense, perhaps especially if these proposals would be politically popular.

Let me give you two examples, one minor and one much bigger.

The minor example is proposals for a temporary cut in gasoline taxes to reduce inflationary pressures. There are some good arguments against doing this; in the long run we want to discourage people from burning fossil fuels, not make them cheaper. But I’ve been astonished to encounter Democratic-leaning economists and economics writers asserting that a gas-tax cut wouldn’t help consumers and that it would simply increase oil company profits.

What? The price of crude oil is set on world markets and can’t be much influenced by U.S. policy. But there’s no world market for retail gasoline; Europeans can’t fill their tanks at American gas stations. There are, in fact, large international differences in gasoline prices, precisely because tax rates are so different. And the data, presented here for the Group of 7 economies, suggests a roughly one-to-one effect — that is, higher or lower fuel taxes are fully passed on to consumers:

Why assert anything different? I can only guess that it’s an instinctive reaction against anything that sounds crowd-pleasing.

The same thing is, I suspect, going on when Democratic-leaning economists summarily reject suggestions — most notably by Elizabeth Warren — that corporate abuse of market power may be one factor in inflation, or (not quite the same point) that stepped-up antitrust efforts might be a useful part of anti-inflation strategy. These views have wide public support, but the Biden administration has been diffident about advancing them, reportedly because its economists are reluctant to challenge the professional orthodoxy that such things can’t happen.

I understand where that orthodoxy is coming from. It’s not a naïve denial that corporations are greedy or have price-setting market power. It comes, instead, from the assertion that corporations have always been greedy and had market power, and there’s no reason to believe that these problems have suddenly gotten worse.

This argument, however, misses two important points.

The first is that market power gives businesses some wiggle room on prices. Yes, there’s a profit-maximizing price, but the cost to a business of charging somewhat less than its profit-maximizing price is small, because lower margins would be offset by increased sales. (To be formal about it, the losses caused by deviating from the optimal price are second-order.) This wiggle room means that corporate pricing may be strongly influenced by intangible considerations, like fear of alienating buyers. A similar argument helps explain why social pressure and prevailing norms seem to have a strong effect on wage rates, and a related argument helps explain why minimum wages don’t seem to reduce employment.

Given this reality, it’s not foolish to suggest that some corporations have seen widespread inflation as an opportunity to jack up prices by more than their costs have increased without experiencing the usual backlash. And it’s not just liberal politicians saying this: Recently the market analyst Edward Yardeni, explaining why profits soared in 2021, declared that “it kind of became culturally acceptable to raise prices” because everyone knew that costs were going up. This phenomenon may, for example, explain recent huge price increases in the meatpacking industry.

Nobody sensible would argue that opportunistic exploitation of market power is the main factor behind recent inflation. But contrary to what some people might want you to believe, economic theory by no means rules out the possibility that it may be a factor.

And perhaps an even more important point, cracking down on excessive industrial concentration and market power would help reduce inflation, regardless of the role market power played in causing inflation in the first place. As an old line puts it, you don’t have to refill a flat tire through the hole.

Now, it would clearly be a mistake to make a campaign against price gouging the core of America’s economic strategy. But nobody is suggesting doing that. At this point, monetary policy is bearing the main burden of inflation-fighting, and the Biden administration — unlike its predecessor — has been careful about not placing pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low. Republicans may portray Joe Biden as the second coming of Hugo Chavez, but he isn’t even the second coming of Richard Nixon, who tried to fight inflation with price controls while a complaisant Fed, probably trying to ensure his re-election, helped create an unsustainable boom.

In fact, Biden has been far less forthright about condemning corporate power than John F. Kennedy, who publicly berated the steel industry over what he considered excessive price hikes.

Why, then, are Democratic-leaning economists coming down so hard on the Biden administration’s modest, intellectually defensible attempts to highlight the role of abusive corporate pricing? As I said, I suspect that the desire of Democratic experts to avoid being seen as hacks is causing them to overcompensate, dismissing ideas that actually make sense.

So here’s a plea to my fellow wonks: Evaluate economic ideas on their merits. You don’t want to endorse bad policies because they’re popular, but you don’t want to reject policy ideas simply because they are popular, either.",1,[],[],"['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']"

She will never be anything more than what she currently is, a “legislator” with no interest in legislating and with zero influence on any of the committees that actually shape public policy. Not a thing she does has any influence on how the country is actually run. All she’ll ever be is a verbal bomb thrower in the GOP’s stupid “culture wars,” she lacks any of the charisma and intelligence necessary to ever become an influential leader so the idea that one is being “vigilant” by constantly giving her the attention she wants is a self-indulgent fantasy. Her only reason for existing is to do offensive stunts like this and then raise money from the basket of Deplorables that are her followers when decent people get horrified. **Stop fucking helping her**. 

While everyone pays attention to these irrelevant losers like Boebert and Greene, guys like Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley and Dan Crenshaw fly under the radar. They’re a million times more dangerous. Cotton and Hawley are fucking Nazis and Hawley certainly seems to have an affinity for the language of fascism.

“It would be extraordinarily difficult to expand Nato eastward without that action’s being viewed by Russia as unfriendly. Even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of the old Soviet Union. Some of the more ambitious versions would have the alliance virtually surround the Russian Federation itself.” I wrote those words in 1994, in my book Beyond Nato: Staying Out of Europe’s Wars, at a time when expansion proposals merely constituted occasional speculation in foreign policy seminars in New York and Washington. I added that expansion “would constitute a needless provocation of Russia”.
 
&gt;What was not publicly known at the time was that Bill Clinton’s administration had already made the fateful decision the previous year to push for including some former Warsaw Pact countries in Nato. The administration would soon propose inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to become members, and the US Senate approved adding those countries to the North Atlantic Treaty in 1998. It would be the first of several waves of membership expansion.

&gt; Even that first stage provoked Russian opposition and anger. In her memoir, Madeleine Albright, Clinton’s secretary of state, concedes that “[Russian president Boris] Yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europe’s dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated.”

&gt;Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, similarly described the Russian attitude. “Many Russians see Nato as a vestige of the cold war, inherently directed against their country. They point out that they have disbanded the Warsaw Pact, their military alliance, and ask why the west should not do the same.” It was an excellent question, and neither the Clinton administration nor its successors provided even a remotely convincing answer.

&gt;George Kennan, the intellectual father of America’s containment policy during the cold war, perceptively warned in a May 1998 New York Times interview about what the Senate’s ratification of Nato’s first round of expansion would set in motion. “I think it is the beginning of a new cold war,” Kennan stated. ”I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else.”

&gt;He was right, but US and Nato leaders proceeded with new rounds of expansion, including the provocative step of adding the three Baltic republics. Those countries not only had been part of the Soviet Union, but they had also been part of Russia’s empire during the Czarist era. That wave of expansion now had Nato perched on the border of the Russian Federation.

---



If you thought the antiabortion vigilante law Texas Republicans passed last year was the most appalling abuse of legislative power you’d ever seen, I have some bad news for you.

That law was a wake-up call, not to Democrats — who seem to have done almost nothing in response — but to Republicans across the country. It said to them, We don’t have to hold back anymore. We can do anything we want.

And that’s just what they’re doing.

We’re witnessing a new phase not only in the culture wars but in U.S. politics generally. Republicans are arriving at a reimagined view of power, one without limit or restraint.

Consider Missouri, where a Republican state representative has proposed to take part of the Texas model — making abortion all but illegal by allowing anyone to sue those who help a woman get one — and taking it across state borders. Her bill would allow lawsuits targeting anyone who helps a Missouri resident obtain an abortion in another state, so that if a woman who lives in St. Louis drove her daughter to Illinois to get a legal abortion there, anyone could sue her.

In effect, it would make it all but illegal for a woman who lives in Missouri to get an abortion anywhere in the country.

If that shocks you, just wait. In Idaho, the state House just passed a bill that would make it illegal to provide puberty blockers or other hormonal treatment to trans kids. The bill’s language says that not only physicians but also “whoever knowingly gives permission for, or permits on a child” these treatments — i.e., parents — will be guilty of a felony and can be sentenced to life in prison.

Every Republican except one in the Idaho House voted for it.

Meanwhile, Texas is already sending child protective services to investigate families who provide loving support to their trans kids, a potential prelude to declaring the parents child abusers and sending the kids off to foster care.

In state after state, bills that a few years ago might have died in committee because they were too extreme are now on their way to passage.

Republican legislatures are reaching into classrooms to ban the utterance of “divisive concepts” and books that conservative Republicans find unsettling. Florida just passed its “don’t say gay” bill, targeted at teachers of kindergarten through third grade who mention sexuality or gender identity and once again using the threat of ruinous lawsuits against individuals to impose its will.

Something has changed, and it isn’t that a wave of extremist Republicans got elected at the state level and pushed out their “reasonable” predecessors. That may be part of the story, but it didn’t all happen at once, like the tea party wave of 2010.

Instead, extreme Republicans have gotten elected to state legislatures over the course of the past few elections and have worked their way up the ranks. You’re familiar with trolls in Congress, such as Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), but there are dozens or even hundreds like them in state legislatures around the country.

Even Republicans who have been in office for many years are going along with this new radicalism. The extremists are working with their party’s leadership. Whether out of fear of being primaried or because they finally feel free to indulge their darkest fantasies, the longer-serving members seem nearly as enthusiastic about this new lack of restraint as anyone. And the bills have support from Republican governors who are hardly insurgents within their party.

A number of factors set the stage for the emergence of this new authoritarianism. The most obvious is Donald Trump’s takeover of the GOP, which took all the party’s worst attributes — its reliance on anger and resentment as mobilizing tools, its contempt for democratic norms, its loathing for Americans it disagrees with — and supercharged them.

Conservative media has also grown more radical; the most popular conservative media figure in the country is an anti-vaccine crusader whose show is a forum for race-baiting, conspiracy theories, and pro-Putin propaganda. That poison is spread to both Republican voters and officeholders, pushing them to be more extreme in their tactics and demands.

Then you have the way power is divided in the country at the moment. Democrats control Washington, which creates a visible target for right-wing anger, while Republicans dominate at the state level, which gives them the ability to express that anger in legislation. It’s all enabled by gerrymandering and other means of eliminating democratic accountability that assure Republicans that nothing they do will threaten their hold on power.

Central to the enterprise is the idea that Democrats are the ones promoting an insane agenda, which serves as the justification for almost anything Republicans want to do. Since Democrats are so horrifying, say Republicans, no tactic is too immoral to utilize, no Republican candidate too dangerous to support, and no proposal too offensive to pass in opposing them.

It’s why former attorney general William P. Barr describes in detail how Trump tried to stage a coup against U.S. democracy — then says that if Trump is the 2024 Republican nominee he’ll vote for him to combat the “threat” from the left. It’s why the hateful Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers can speak at white supremacist rallies and the state’s governor will respond to questions about her by saying, “She’s still better than her opponent.”

And it’s why almost no Republican officeholders anywhere will speak out against their party’s authoritarian radicalism. The further they push, the more they’re convinced they can get away with. It’s only going to get worse.",4,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---

Just a few weeks ago many influential figures on the U.S. right loved, just loved Vladimir Putin. In fact, some of them still can’t quit him. For example, Tucker Carlson, while he has grudgingly backed off from full-on Putin support, is still blaming America for the war and promoting Russian disinformation about U.S.-funded bioweapons labs.

For the most part, however, America’s Putin lovers are having a moment of truth. It’s not so much that Putin stands revealed as a tyrant willing to kill large numbers of innocent people — they knew or should have known that already. The problem is that the strongman they admired — whom Donald Trump praised as “savvy” and a “genius” just before he invaded Ukraine — is turning out to be remarkably weak. And that’s not an accident. Russia is facing disaster precisely because it is ruled by a man who accepts no criticism and brooks no dissent.

On the military side, a war Russia clearly envisioned as a blitzkrieg that would overrun Ukraine in days has yet to capture any of the country’s top 10 cities — although long-range bombardment is turning those cities into rubble. On the economic side, Putin’s attempt to insulate himself from potential Western sanctions has been a debacle, with everything indicating that Russia will have a depression-level slump. To see why this matters, you need to understand the sources of the right’s infatuation with a brutal dictator, an infatuation that began even before Trump’s rise.

Some of this dictator-love reflected the belief that Putin was a champion of antiwokeness — someone who wouldn’t accuse you of being a racist, who denounced cancel culture and “gay propaganda.”

Some of it reflected a creepy fascination with Putin’s alleged masculinity — Sarah Palin declared that he wrestled bears while President Barack Obama wore “mom jeans” — and the apparent toughness of Putin’s people. Just last year Senator Ted Cruz contrasted footage of a shaven-headed Russian soldier with a U.S. Army recruiting ad to mock our “woke, emasculated” military.

Finally, many on the right simply like the idea of authoritarian rule. Just a few days ago Trump, who has dialed back his praise for Putin, chose instead to express admiration for North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. Kim’s generals and aides, he noted, “cowered” when the dictator spoke, adding that “I want my people to act like that.”

But we’re now relearning an old lesson: Sometimes, what looks like strength is actually a source of weakness.

Whatever eventually happens in the war, it’s clear that Russia’s military was far less formidable than it appeared on paper. Russian forces appear to be undertrained and badly led; there also seem to be problems with Russian equipment, such as communications devices.

These weaknesses might have been apparent to Putin before the war if investigative journalists or independent watchdogs within his government had been in a position to assess the country’s true military readiness. But such things aren’t possible in Putin’s Russia.

The invaders were also clearly shocked by Ukraine’s resistance — both by its resolve and by its competence. Realistic intelligence assessments might have warned Russia that this might happen; but would you want to have been the official standing up and saying, “Mr. President, I’m afraid we may be underestimating the Ukrainians”?

On the economic side, I have to admit that both the West’s willingness to impose sanctions and the effectiveness of those sanctions have surprised just about everyone, myself included.

Still, economic officials and independent experts in Russia should have warned Putin in advance that “Fortress Russia” was a deeply flawed idea. It shouldn’t have required deep analysis to realize that Putin’s $630 billion in foreign exchange reserves would become largely unusable if the world’s democracies cut off Russia’s access to the world banking system. It also shouldn’t have required deep analysis to realize that Russia’s economy is deeply dependent on imports of capital goods and other essential industrial inputs.

But again, would you have wanted to be the diplomat telling Putin that the West isn’t as decadent as he thinks, the banker telling him that his vaunted “war chest” will be useless in a crisis, the economist telling him that Russia needs imports?

The point is that the case for an open society — a society that allows dissent and criticism — goes beyond truth and morality. Open societies are also, by and large, more effective than closed-off autocracies. That is, while you might imagine that there are big advantages to rule by a strongman who can simply tell people what to do, these advantages are more than offset by the absence of free discussion and independent thought. Nobody can tell the strongman that he’s wrong or urge him to think twice before making a disastrous decision.

Which brings me back to America’s erstwhile Putin admirers. I’d like to think that they’ll take Russia’s Ukraine debacle as an object lesson and rethink their own hostility to democracy. OK, I don’t really expect that to happen. But we can always hope.",7,[],[],"['Barack Obama', 'Donald Trump']"

---

Last week Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, released a revised estimate of the euro area’s February inflation rate. It wasn’t a happy report: Consumer prices were up 5.9 percent from a year earlier, more than most analysts had expected. And it’s going to get worse, as the effects of the Ukraine war weigh on food and energy prices.

Britain hasn’t yet released its February inflation number, but the Bank of England expects it to match the rate in the euro area.

Of course, U.S. inflation is even higher, with February consumer prices up 7.9 percent from a year earlier. These numbers aren’t exactly comparable, for technical reasons, but inflation in the U.S. does seem to be running around two percentage points higher than in Europe. I’ll come back to that difference and what might explain it. But surely the fact that inflation is up a lot in many countries, not just America, is worth noting.

After all, the entire Republican Party and a fair number of conservative Democrats insist that the recent surge in U.S. inflation was caused by President Biden’s big spending policies. Europe, however, had nothing comparable to Biden’s American Rescue Plan; last year the euro area’s structural budget deficit, a standard measure of fiscal stimulus, was only about a third as large, as a percentage of G.D.P., as America’s.

So why is inflation up in Europe?

Part of the answer is rising energy prices. Last week I noted that Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House minority leader, has declared that gasoline prices “are not Putin gas prices. They are President Biden gas prices.” Let me elaborate on the absurdity of that claim, using British data.

In late December 2020 gasoline in Britain cost 116 pence per liter — $5.94 a gallon. By mid-March that was up to $8.23 a gallon. Over the same period U.S. gas prices rose from $2.24 to $4.32. Taking Britain’s high gas taxes into account, the price increases were similar, even though Joe Biden is not, as far as I know, the British prime minister.

But it’s not just energy prices. U.S. inflation has been driven up in part by pervasive supply-chain problems, with a big shift of demand toward goods straining ports, shipping capacity and more; these same strains, which have lasted much longer than many of us expected, have afflicted Europe, too.

So what does high inflation in Europe tell us? First, that a large part — maybe two-thirds — of the acceleration in U.S. inflation reflects global forces rather than specifically American policies and developments. Second, because these global forces may abate if we finally emerge from this dark tunnel of pandemic and war, U.S. inflation may eventually decline substantially even without drastic changes in policy. (Notice how I avoided using the word “transitory”? Oh, wait.)

That said, inflation is running hotter on this side of the Atlantic. Why? One main factor, almost surely, is that the economy of the United States has recovered faster than that of Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2021 real gross domestic product in the U.S. was 3 percent larger than it had been before the pandemic, while the euro area had barely recovered its losses. And in case you’re wondering, you don’t need to discount those numbers for faster U.S. population growth; our working-age population has in fact stagnated since 2019, largely thanks to a collapse in immigration.

And U.S. economic growth has helped workers as well as G.D.P. Although hourly real wages have been eroded by inflation, total labor compensation is up 13.6 percent since the eve of the pandemic, compared with only 5.2 percent in Europe.

Now, excess inflation suggests that recent U.S. economic growth has been too much of a good thing. Our economy looks clearly overheated, which is why the Federal Reserve is right to have started raising interest rates and should keep doing it until inflation subsides.

But while overheating is a problem, we shouldn’t let it overshadow the good things that have happened. We recovered fast from the pandemic recession and seem to have avoided the long-term “scarring” effects that many feared. Most though not all of the inflation we’re experiencing reflects probably temporary global forces, and multiple indicators — consumer surveys, professional forecasters and financial markets — suggest that longer-term expectations of inflation remain “anchored,” that is, inflation isn’t getting entrenched in the economy.

There’s still the question of why Americans feel so lousy about the economy, or at least tell pollsters that they feel lousy (they’re spending as if they’re optimistic). We’re not unique in this respect: European consumer sentiment has also taken a hit in the face of inflation, although nothing like the plunge we’ve seen here. But that’s a topic I’ll return to another day.

For now, I’d just urge Americans to look at their economy in the European mirror. Recovering from the pandemic was always going to be tough, and Vladimir Putin has made it tougher. But under the circumstances, we’re actually doing relatively OK.",1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

---

Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was, first and foremost, a crime — indeed, the war crimes continue as you read this. But it was also a blunder. In less than five weeks Putin has destroyed Russia’s military reputation, battered his nation’s economy and strengthened the democratic alliances he hoped to undermine. How could he have made such a catastrophic mistake?

Part of the answer, surely, is strongman syndrome: Putin has surrounded himself with people who tell him what he wants to hear. All indications are that he went into this debacle believing his own propaganda about both his army’s martial prowess and the eagerness of Ukrainians to submit to Russian rule.

But there’s also reason to think Putin, like many of his admirers in the West, thought modern democracies were too decadent to offer effective resistance.

And here’s the thing: When I look at the United States, I worry that the West is, in fact, being made weaker by decadence — but not the kind that obsesses Putin and those who think like him. Our vulnerability comes not from the decline of traditional family values, but from the decline of traditional democratic values, such as a belief in the rule of law and a willingness to accept the results of elections that don’t go your way.

Of course, the idea that loose morals destroy great powers goes back centuries. In the Hollywood version of history, the Roman Empire fell because its elites were too busy with orgies to attend to the business of defeating barbarians. Actually, the timing is all wrong on that story, but I’ll get back to that in a minute.

Today’s right-wingers seem bothered less by weakness from sexual license than by weakness from gender equality: Tucker Carlson warned that China’s military was becoming “more masculine” while ours was becoming “more feminine, whatever feminine means anymore, since men and women no longer exist.” Senator Ted Cruz retweeted a video comparing a U.S. Army recruiting video with footage of a Russian paratrooper with a shaved head and declared that a “woke, emasculated military” might not be a good idea.

It would be interesting to know what has happened to that paratrooper since Putin invaded Ukraine. In any case, the heavy casualties suffered by Russia’s anti-woke military as it failed to overrun vastly inferior Ukrainian forces have confirmed what anyone who has studied history knows: Modern wars aren’t won with swaggering machismo. Courage and endurance, physical and moral, are as essential as ever; but so are more mundane things like logistics, vehicle maintenance and communications systems that actually work.

By the way, I can’t help mentioning that recent events have also confirmed the truism that many, perhaps most men who pose as tough guys … aren’t. Putin’s response to failure in Ukraine has been extremely Trumpian: insisting that his invasion is all going “according to plan,” refusing to admit having made any mistakes and whining about cancel culture. I’m half expecting him to release battle maps crudely modified with a Sharpie.

But back to the kind of decadence that really matters.

As I said, the Hollywood version of Rome’s decline and fall doesn’t stand up under examination. True, the spoils of empire made it possible for a few people to live in great luxury, possibly including the occasional orgy; the closest modern counterpart to that elite would be … Russian oligarchs. But Rome retained its territorial integrity and military effectiveness for centuries after the emergence of that pampered, libertine elite.

So what did go wrong? Historians have many theories, but surely a big factor was the erosion of norms that had helped establish political legitimacy, and the ever-growing willingness of some Romans, especially after around 180 C.E., to use violence against one another.

Obviously what’s going on in the U.S. today bears no detailed resemblance to the troubles of the ancient world. Yet these days not a month goes by without further revelations that a large part of America’s body politic, very much including members of the political elite, has contempt for democratic principles and will do whatever it takes to win.

It’s incredible how quickly we’ve normalized the fact that the last president tried to retain power despite losing the election and that a mob he incited stormed the Capitol. Many people took part in the effort to overturn the election — among them, we recently learned, the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice, who hasn’t even recused himself in cases about the attempted coup.

And while Donald Trump’s effort to stay in office failed, most of his party has, in effect, retroactively backed that effort.

Why is that relevant to Ukraine? Putin effectively bet that an effete West would stand by as he carried out his conquest. Instead, President Biden very effectively mobilized a democratic alliance that has rushed aid to Ukraine and helped humiliate the aggressor.

But the next time something like this happens, America might not lead an effective alliance of democracies, because we ourselves will have given up on democratic values.

And that, if you ask me, is what real decadence looks like.",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---

So Donald Trump has endorsed J.D. Vance in the race for Ohio’s Republican Senate nomination. Will Trump’s nod tip the balance? I have no idea, and frankly I don’t care.

Ohio’s G.O.P. primary has, after all, been a race to the bottom, with candidates seemingly competing to see who can be crasser, who can do the most to dumb down the debate. Vance insists that “what’s happening in Ukraine has nothing to do with our national security” and that we should focus instead on the threat from immigrants crossing our southern border. Josh Mandel, who has been leading in the polls, says that Ohio should be a “pro-God, pro-family, pro-Bitcoin state.” And so on. Any of these candidates would be a terrible senator, and it’s anyone’s guess who’d be worst.

But the thing about Vance is that while these days he gives cynical opportunism a bad name, he didn’t always seem that way. In fact, not that long ago he seemed to offer some intellectual and maybe even moral heft. His 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” drew widespread and respectful attention, because it offered a personal take on a real and important problem: The unraveling of society in Appalachia and more broadly for a significant segment of the white working class.

Yet neither Vance nor, as far as I can tell, any other notable figure in the Republican Party is advocating any real policies to address this problem. They’re happy to exploit white working-class resentment; but when it comes to doing anything to improve their supporters’ lives, their implicit slogan is, “Let them eat hate.”

Let’s talk for a minute about the reality Vance was writing about back when many took him seriously.

I still encounter people who imagine that social dysfunction is mainly a problem involving nonwhite residents of big cities. But that picture is decades out of date. The social problems that have festered in 21st-century America — notably large numbers of prime-age males not working and widespread “deaths of despair” from drugs, suicide and alcohol — have if anything fallen most heavily on rural and small-town whites, especially in parts of the heartland that have been left behind as a knowledge-centered economy increasingly favors high-education metropolitan areas.

What can be done? Progressives want to see more social spending, especially on families with children; this would do a lot to improve people’s lives, although it’s less clear whether it would help revive declining communities.

Back in 2016 Trump offered a different answer: protectionist trade policies that, he claimed, would revive industrial employment. The arithmetic on this claim never worked, and in practice Trump’s trade wars appear to have reduced the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs. But back then Trump was at least pretending to address a real issue.

At this point, however, neither Trump nor any other important Republican is willing to go even that far. I’d say that G.O.P. campaigning in 2022 is all culture war, all the time, except that this would be giving Republicans too much credit. They aren’t fighting a real culture war, a conflict between rival views of what our society should look like; they’re riling up the base against phantasms, threats that don’t even exist.

This isn’t hyperbole. I’m not just talking about things like the panic over critical race theory, although this has come to mean just about any mention of the role that slavery and discrimination have played in U.S. history. Florida is even rejecting many math textbooks, claiming that they include prohibited topics.

That’s bad. But we’re seeing a growing focus on even more bizarre conspiracy theories, with frantic attacks on woke Disney, etc. And roughly half of self-identified Republicans believe that “top Democrats are involved in elite child sex-trafficking rings.”

What people may not realize is that Vance’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is almost as detached from reality as QAnon-type theories about Democratic pedophiles. I mean, yes, undocumented immigrants do exist. But the idea that they pose a major threat to public order is a fantasy; indeed, the evidence suggests that they’re considerably more law-abiding than native-born Americans.

And making the alleged insecurity of the southern border your signature campaign issue is especially bizarre if you’re running for office in Ohio, where immigrants make up only 4.8 percent of the population — around a third of the national average. (Almost 38 percent of the population of New York City, and 45 percent of its work force, is immigrant. It’s not exactly a dystopian hellhole.)

But look, none of this is a mystery. Republicans are following an old playbook, one that would have been completely familiar to, say, czarist-era instigators of pogroms. When the people are suffering, you don’t try to solve their problems; instead, you distract them by giving them someone to hate.

And history tells us that this tactic often works.

As I said, I have no idea whether Trump’s endorsement of Vance will matter. What I do know is that the G.O.P. as a whole has turned to hate-based politics. And if you aren’t afraid, you aren’t paying attention.",2,[],[],['Donald Trump']

Otherwise, their position is wholly without merit. The endorsement of that position by the majority of this Court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today's decision. One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.

---

I never thought I’d say this, but I miss voodoo economics.

It was shocking at the time when a crank economic doctrine — the claim that tax cuts pay for themselves — became, in effect, the official Republican party line. It was dismaying to see that doctrine’s hold on the party become ever more entrenched even as the evidence for its falsity (the Clinton economic boom, the lackluster performance of the Bush economy even before the 2008 financial crisis, the tax-cut debacle in Kansas, the failure of the Trump tax cuts to generate an investment boom) kept accumulating.

And voodoo economics continues to do real damage to this day. The Republicans who control Mississippi, a poor state with desperately underfunded educational programs that’s closing hospitals, recently moved to boost the state’s economy by … cutting taxes.

As far as I know, however, diatribes about the evils of high marginal tax rates haven’t inspired any acts of domestic terrorism.

As has been widely reported, the suspect accused of fatally shooting 10 people in Buffalo is a devotee of “replacement theory,” which claims that sinister elites — especially Jews, of course — are deliberately bringing in immigrants to displace and disempower white Americans. So were the men charged with massacres at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018 and an El Paso Walmart in 2019.

Replacement theory used to be a fringe doctrine, but these days, in at best thinly disguised form, it is attracting significant mainstream support within the G.O.P. And this mainstream acceptance helps it spread.

As The Times has documented, Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show has amplified the doctrine more than 400 times. And lest you dismiss Carlson as a mere media figure, remember David Frum’s dictum: “Republicans originally thought Fox worked for us. Then we discovered that we work for Fox.”

In any case, a growing number of prominent G.O.P. politicians also espouse barely veiled versions of replacement theory. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking Republican in the House, has run Facebook ads claiming that Democrats want to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants to “overthrow our current electorate.” J.D. Vance, the Republican nominee for Senate in Ohio, claims that “Biden’s open border” is bringing “more Democrat voters pouring into this country.”

Why is the paranoid style taking over the Republican Party? Facts have little to do with it. Some of the most anti-immigrant politicians come from places with hardly any immigrants: Fewer than 5 percent of Ohioans and fewer than 4 percent of the residents of Stefanik’s district, in New York, are foreign-born. In New York City the share is almost 38 percent.

Nor does there seem to be a popular groundswell driving this political shift. Yes, large numbers of Americans are anti-immigrant, racially hostile, or both. But this has always been true. Public opinion seems, if anything, to be more favorable to immigration than in the past; indicators of racial tolerance, like approval of interracial marriage, are at historic highs.

What has changed, however, is the behavior of Republican elites, who used to push back against conspiracy theories but now cheerfully embrace them whenever it seems politically expedient.

Which, I’d argue, is where voodoo economics comes in — not as an idea but as a determinant of the kind of people who became Republican politicians.

The rise of supply-side economics coincided with the rise of movement conservatism — an interlocking network of elected officials, media organizations, think tanks and lobbying firms. Because the movement’s core ideology involved reducing taxes on the rich, it was lavishly supported by billionaires and corporate interests, and this in turn meant that it offered job security to anyone who remained sufficiently loyal.

Who was attracted to this movement? Many were careerists: people happy to serve as apparatchiks, following whatever the party line happened to be at the moment. They may have signed up to promote low taxes and a weaker safety net, but most of the party immediately went MAGA when the winds shifted.

Stefanik is a perfect example: a Paul Ryan protégé who pivoted seamlessly to full Trumpism, including false claims of election fraud, and now to promotion of the great replacement theory.

Someone like Vance, who isn’t a professional political operative, is actually the exception that proves the rule. His defining characteristic is opportunism: a Trump denouncer turned slavish acolyte, a self-proclaimed champion of the rural poor who opposes any program that might help them. And his very lack of an ethical center is probably why Donald Trump endorsed him.

So when I say that I miss voodoo economics, what I really mean is that I miss the illusion — which I shared — that the impact of its rise would mainly be limited to the politics of taxes and spending. What we now know is that the embrace of crank economics presaged the general moral collapse of the Republican establishment.

This collapse opened the door for paranoia and conspiracy theorists of all kinds — and the consequences have been deadly. There is, I would argue, a direct line from the Laffer curve, to Jan. 6, to Buffalo.",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---

The sultans of Silicon Valley are in a political snit, with some billionaires suddenly turning against Democrats. It’s not just Elon Musk. Other prominent players, including Jeff Bezos, have lashed out at the Biden administration, and we now know that Oracle’s Larry Ellison participated in a call with Sean Hannity and Lindsey Graham about overturning the 2020 election.

The timing of this hard right turn by some tech aristocrats is remarkable given what’s happening in U.S. politics. It’s hard, for example, to imagine what kind of bubble Musk lives in that he could declare Democrats “the party of division and hate” at a time when Tucker Carlson, not a politician but still one of the most influential figures in the modern G.O.P., is devoting show after show to “replacement theory,” the claim that liberal elites are deliberately bringing immigrants to America to displace white voters. (Polls show that nearly half of Republicans agree with this theory.)

The plutocrats railing against Democrats are also remarkably petty; nothing says “visionary titan of industry” like sending poop emojis. But the pettiness may actually be central to the political story. What’s going on here, I’d argue, isn’t mainly about greed (although that, too). It is, instead, largely about fragile egos.

It’s true that some real economic interests are at stake. Democrats have proposed new taxes on the wealthy, while President Biden has appointed officials known for advocating much stronger antitrust policy. It’s also true that tech stocks have fallen substantially over the past few months, reducing the paper wealth of moguls like Musk and Bezos.

But at this point these look like policies at the edges. Even if Democrats defy the odds and retain control of Congress this November, there is no realistic prospect of a New Deal-type campaign against extreme inequality. Furthermore, any conceivable redistributive policy would still leave billionaires incredibly wealthy, able to buy anything they want (except, possibly, Twitter).

What wealth can’t always buy, however, is admiration. And that’s an area in which the tech titans have suffered major losses.

Let me get nerdy for a minute. At least since the work of Max Weber a century ago, social scientists have realized that social inequality has multiple dimensions. At minimum we need to distinguish between the hierarchy of money, in which some people have a disproportionate share of society’s wealth, and the hierarchy of prestige, in which some people are specially respected and looked up to.

People may occupy very different positions in these hierarchies. Sports legends, pop stars, social media “influencers” and, yes, Nobel laureates generally do fine financially, but their wealth is surely mere pocket change compared with today’s great fortunes. Billionaires, by contrast, command deference, even servility, from those who depend on their largess, but few of them are widely known public figures and even fewer have dedicated fan bases.

The tech elite, however, had it all. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg was, for a while, a feminist icon. Musk has millions of Twitter followers, many of them actual human beings rather than bots, and these followers have often been ardent Tesla defenders.

Now the glitter is gone. Social media, once hailed as a force for freedom, are now denounced as vectors of misinformation. Tesla boosterism has been dented by tales of spontaneous combustion and autopilot accidents. Technology moguls still possess vast wealth, but the public — and the administration — isn’t offering the old level of adulation.

And it’s driving them crazy.

We’ve seen this movie before. Back in 2010 much of the Wall Street elite, rather than feeling grateful for having been bailed out, was consumed with “Obama rage.” Financial wheeler-dealers were furious at not, in their view, receiving the respect they deserved after, um, crashing the world economy.

Unfortunately, plutocratic pettiness matters. Money can’t buy admiration, but it can buy political power; it’s disheartening that some of this power will be deployed on behalf of a Republican Party that is descending ever deeper into authoritarianism.

Did I mention that the most recent meeting of the right-wing gathering CPAC, which included a video address from Donald Trump, was held in Hungary under the auspices of Viktor Orban, who has effectively killed his nation’s democracy?

The right turn by some technology billionaires is also, may I say, very stupid.

It’s true that oligarchs can get very rich under autocrats like Orban or Vladimir Putin, whom much of the U.S. right deeply admired until he began losing his war in Ukraine.

There is no ""election holiday"" from prosecution.  Pretending that there is, is not based in law, so the policy is *unlawful*.  If the legislature wanted to *make* it a law, they've had nearly two and a half centuries to do it.

How about the DOJ respecting the people's right to have their laws enforced in a timely fashion, outweighing a suspect's *non-right* to be elected?  How about the people's right to reject a candidate who *has the appearance* of criminality?  If found not guilty, there's always another election.  Getting rid of a criminal incumbent damn near takes an act of god.  Allowing a suspect to remain unindicted when enough evidence exists to indict *supports* those criminal behaviors.

IF THEY MUST, the DOJ can AT LEAST put the evidence before a judge in camera, and let a judge decide if there's enough preponderance of evidence to reach a conviction, and if so, indict the suspect candidate and let a jury decide.  The DOJ has no lawful power or authority to decide on his own to *fail to indict*.

Garland should follow the law without favor or prejudice, and toss that ""special class favor"" of so-called candidate holidays.

He suggested that the Justice Department has been unjustly tougher on Capitol riot defendants compared with people arrested at protests against police brutality and racial injustice after George Floyd’s 2020 murder by a Minneapolis police officer.

&gt;McFadden also has criticized prosecutors for seeking jail time for some nonviolent Capitol riot defendants but not for left-wing activists who protested Trump’s nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, The Washington Post reported.

&gt;In April, McFadden acquitted New Mexico resident Matthew Martin of misdemeanor charges that he illegally entered the Capitol and engaged in disorderly conduct after he walked into the building.

&gt;Martin testified that a police officer waved him into the building. A prosecutor rejected that testimony as “nonsense,” but McFadden said it was reasonable for Martin to believe that outnumbered police officers allowed him to enter the Capitol through the Rotunda doors.

God no wonder these defendants requested a bench trial instead of a jury.

&gt; Former Fox News politics editor: Trump&amp;#039;s anger in 2020 led to &amp;#039;panic&amp;#039; at Fox In an interview with NPR, former Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt says that network should have been proud of being first to project that Joe Biden would win Arizona.

&gt; &amp;quot;Fox lost the thread over time, but the old idea at Fox was a robust news division,&amp;quot; Stirewalt said.

&gt; Fox News largely skirted clear of talking about Stirewalt on Monday after his testimony, focusing instead on videotaped depositions of former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien and other campaign advisers and attorneys.

House and Senate leaders for the Democratic Party would appoint the commission chair and four other members, while the Republican leaders would appoint the vice chair and four other members.
The day before the House voted on the legislation, Trump came out in opposition to it and called on Republicans to ""not approve the Democrat trap of the Jan. 6 Commission,"" arguing that it amounted to ""more partisan unfairness."" House Republican leaders joined Trump in opposition. Despite this, the House passed the legislation, with universal support from Democrats and the backing of 35 breakaway Republicans. 
But the Senate killed the commission idea after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., came out against it, effectively ending any hope that the bill could get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.
Democratic leaders’ plan B was to establish a congressional select committee — a time-limited panel with a specific investigative charge. This could be accomplished by the House on its own; a simple majority in the House would carry the day

Consider me educated

E: wow I continue to get educated

&gt; Under the resolution, ""the Speaker shall appoint 13 Members to the Select Committee, 5 of whom shall be appointed after consultation with the minority leader."" 
This is where matters got even more convoluted. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., presented Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., with a slate of five nominees to the panel. Pelosi responded that she had no quarrel with three of them: Republican Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, and Troy Nehls of Texas. But she drew the line at two of McCarthy’s picks: Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who was tapped for the panel’s ranking member slot, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. Pelosi maintained that Banks and Jordan were too closely tied to Trump to help carry out a credible investigation.
After Pelosi rejected Banks and Jordan, McCarthy retracted all five of his nominations, including the three that Pelosi had said she’d accept. ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the unprecedented step of denying the minority party's picks for the Select Committee on January 6,"" McCarthy said at the time. ""This represents an egregious abuse of power and will irreparably damage this institution.""

55136,2022-07-11 22:35:50,GOP leaders are literally speechless about the good news on jobs,,2022-07-12 00:39:54,AmericanPolitics,t3_vwv970,"It seems you too are cherry picking numbers and confirmation biased.

In June, the civilian non-institutional population in the United States was 263,835,000. That included all people 16 and older who did not live in an institution, such as a prison, nursing home or long-term care facility.

Of that civilian non-institutional population, 164,023,000 were participating in the labor force, meaning they were either employed or unemployed -- they either had a job or were actively seeking one during the last month. This resulted in a labor force participation rate of 62.2 percent in June, down from 62.3 percent in May, and two-tenths of a point lower than the Biden-era high of 62.4 percent achieved in March.

The participation rate was 61.4 percent when Joe Biden took office as the pandemic raged. Today's number, 62.2 percent, is still below the Trump-era high of 63.4 percent in February 2020, just before COVID shut things down.

As BLS notes, the labor force participation rate is an important labor market measure because it represents the relative amount of labor resources available for the production of goods and services.

After rising for more than three decades, the overall labor force participation rate peaked in early 2000 at 67.3 percent and subsequently trended down. In recent years, baby-boom retirements have contributed to the decline in the overall participation rate.

The number of Americans not in the labor force -- no job and not looking for one -- increased by 510,000 in June, settling at 99,812,000.

The number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was essentially unchanged at 5.7 million in June. This measure is above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job.

263,835,000 * 0.1% = 263,000 less people working who are still in workforce. So a net loss in jobs. I guess you can call it...""little changed"" and ignore that they are lieing about positive job numbers.",-1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

---

Texas is often hot, but not like this: Current forecasts have the temperature in Dallas hitting 109 degrees Tuesday, with highs in triple digits well into next week.

Britain, on the other hand, used to have a well-deserved reputation as a cool, rainy island. But as I write, the temperature in London is projected to hit 102 degrees Tuesday.

You have to be willfully blind — unfortunately, a fairly common ailment among politicians — not to see that global warming has stopped being a debatable threat that will catch up to us only years from now. It’s our current reality, and if climate scientists — whose warnings have been overwhelmingly vindicated — are right, it’s going to get much worse.

And Joe Manchin just pulled the plug on what may have been the Biden administration’s last chance to do something — anything — meaningful about climate change.

I don’t want to talk much about Manchin. In a few months he’ll probably be irrelevant, one way or another: The odds are either that Republicans will take the Senate or that Democrats, aided by the awfulness of many G.O.P. candidates, will gain some seats. And he wouldn’t have mattered in the first place but for the sickness that has infected America’s body politic.

Still, for what it’s worth, my take on Manchin is both less and more cynical than what you usually hear.

Yes, he represents a state that still thinks of itself as coal country, even though mining is now a trivial part of its economy, dwarfed by jobs in health care and social assistance — with much of the latter paid for by the federal government. Yes, he gets more political contributions from the energy industry than any other member of Congress. Yes, he has a large financial conflict of interest arising from his family’s ownership of a coal business.

Yet my guess is that his Lucy-with-the-football act has as much to do with vanity as with money. (And nothing at all to do with inflation.) His act has, after all, kept him in the political limelight month after month. And if you don’t believe that great events can be shaped, great disasters caused, by sheer personal pettiness, all I can say is that you probably haven’t read much history.

But none of this would have mattered if Republicans weren’t unified in their opposition to any action to limit global warming. This opposition has only grown more entrenched as the evidence for looming catastrophe has grown — and the likely financial cost of effective action has declined.

Let’s talk about the political economy of climate policy.

It has long been painfully obvious that voters are reluctant to accept even small short-run costs in the interest of averting long-run disaster. This is depressing, but it’s a fact of life, one that no amount of haranguing seems likely to change. This is why I’ve long been skeptical of the position, widely held among economists, that a carbon tax — putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions — has to be the central plank of climate policy. It’s true that emission taxes are the Econ 101 solution to pollution, but realistically they just aren’t going to happen in America.

The good news is that spectacular technological progress in renewable energy may offer a foundation for an alternative political strategy, one based on carrots rather than sticks. The idea — which underlay Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan — was to rely not on taxes but on subsidies and public investment to encourage a transition to clean energy. That way climate action could be framed not as sacrifice but as opportunity, a way to create new jobs wrapped up in a broader program of much-needed public investment.

The theory, which I naïvely subscribed to, was that such a strategy, while it might be less efficient than one centered on carbon taxes, would be much easier to sell to the American people, and that there would be at least a few Republican politicians willing to sign on to policies that promised concrete rewards for workers, contractors and so on, without imposing new burdens on their constituents.

But Republicans — and, of course, Manchin — were unmoved. I don’t think they were solely motivated by the desire to see Biden fail. They’re just deeply hostile to clean energy.

There’s an obvious parallel between the politics of green energy and the politics of Covid-19. Many people chafed at the restrictions imposed to limit the pandemic’s spread; even mask requirements involve a bit of inconvenience. But vaccination seemed to offer a win-win solution, letting Americans protect themselves as well as others. Who could possibly object?

The answer was, much of the G.O.P. Vaccination became and remains an intensely partisan issue, with deadly consequences: Death rates since vaccines became widely available have been far higher in strongly Republican areas than in Democratic areas.

The fact is that one of America’s two major political parties appears to be viscerally opposed to any policy that seems to serve the public good. Overwhelming scientific consensus in favor of such policies doesn’t help — if anything, it hurts, because the modern G.O.P. is hostile to science and scientists.

And that hostility, rather than the personal quirks of one small-state senator, is the fundamental reason we appear set to do nothing while the planet burns.",2,[],[],['Joe Biden']

---

Kyrsten Sinema willing, Democrats appear to be on the verge of passing the Inflation Reduction Act — a bill that probably would, indeed, reduce inflation but is mainly a desperately needed effort to limit climate change. Republicans are, of course, attacking the legislation.

But when I look at the substance of those attacks, such as it is, I can’t help feeling more cheerful than I have in months.

For one thing, the debate over the proposal feels like a return to a more innocent time, when Republicans tried to make their case with dishonest claims about economic policy — not insane conspiracy theories and attempts to overthrow democracy.

For another, the G.O.P. critique of the bill is extraordinarily weak. And that’s a good omen for Democrats’ new approach to climate policy — one that relies mainly on carrots rather than sticks, on incentives to do the right thing rather than penalties for doing the wrong thing. We’re already seeing just how hard it is for Republicans to attack this approach, and it will get even harder once the public starts to see the benefits of environmental investments.

So, about that critique. The act calls for $369 billion in climate spending, mainly tax credits for families and businesses that adopt clean-energy technologies, improve energy efficiency, and so on. It would also spend $64 billion on extending subsidies that help keep health insurance affordable.

This new spending would be fully paid for, and then some, mainly by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion. The biggest revenue source is to be a new minimum tax on large corporations. The legislation would also give a desperately underfunded Internal Revenue Service more resources to crack down on tax cheats. And it would seek to save Medicare money by giving the program the power to negotiate over drug prices.

How can Republicans attack such a bill? They can’t openly defend the interests of tax evaders and avoiders, although their long-term efforts to starve the I.R.S. of resources show that in practice they are pro-tax cheater. What they have done, instead, is claim — citing an estimate from Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation — that the legislation would raise taxes on the middle class and that this violates one of Joe Biden’s campaign pledges.

It’s a bogus claim, on multiple levels.

First, the act wouldn’t raise personal income taxes on anyone. Full stop. It just wouldn’t.

What the J.C.T. projects instead are “distributional effects,” an attempt to estimate the indirect burden on families resulting from other taxes, which in this case essentially means the possible effect on wages of requiring large corporations to pay a minimal amount of tax.

Estimating these effects is useful, but are they a “tax increase” on workers? Almost any government policy will have an adverse effect on the income of someone, somewhere; is everything the government does a tax increase?

Opinion Conversation The climate, and the world, are changing. What challenges will the future bring, and how should we respond to them?

Furthermore, if we’re going to consider the indirect effect on family incomes of legislation that doesn’t directly affect their taxes, why not consider the whole act, not just part of it? The J.C.T. table that Republicans are citing notes that it excludes the impact of several major pieces of the bill that would help families, in ways ranging from reduced drug costs and larger health insurance subsidies to clean-energy incentives. Add those in and the middle class almost surely ends up ahead.

Another point I haven’t seen emphasized is that the bill would probably reduce air pollution in general, not just greenhouse gas emissions, which would have major health benefits — and monetary benefits, too.

Wait, there’s more. The J.C.T. assumes that a significant part of the revenue to be gained from taxing corporations would eventually come out of wages. That’s an area of intense academic debate, but there are good reasons to believe that when you’re cracking down on tax avoidance the effect on wages is actually minimal.

Finally, despite all the ways the J.C.T. analysis tilts the playing field against the Inflation Reduction Act, the claimed increase in middle-class taxes is tiny. For example, according to the J.C.T., the federal tax rate on families earning between $50,000 and $75,000 a year would rise from 13.0 percent to … 13.1 percent.

So the G.O.P. attack on this proposal is, in a word, pathetic. The only way it might gain traction is if the media bothsides its reporting, failing to inform news consumers that Republican claims about the bill are, in fact, untrue. That is, unfortunately, a real possibility. Any news report to the effect that “Republicans say the bill would raise middle-class taxes” that doesn’t point out that this claim is false betrays the public interest.

Misinformation aside, however, the right-wing attack on Democrats’ new climate policy is, as I said, extraordinarily weak — and that’s a wonderful thing to see. While the Inflation Reduction Act is a big deal in itself, many of us hope that it will be only the down payment on an even bigger effort to save the planet. And if this is the best the planet’s enemies can do, that’s a very good omen.",1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

---

Gas prices, defying predictions of a nightmare summer for motorists, are leading the parade:

The majority of gas stations in the United States are already charging less than $4 a gallon, and declining wholesale prices suggest that retail prices still have farther to fall.

Food prices are also coming down. Here’s the futures price for wheat:

And business surveys are suggesting a broader decline in inflation. For example, the widely cited Institute of Supply Management survey of purchasing managers shows that prices paid for raw materials are still rising, but at a slower rate than they have in many months:

All of this means that official data on consumer prices will almost certainly show much smaller increases over the next few months than the shocking numbers we’ve become accustomed to lately. But what will this improvement mean?

I’ll get to the implications for economic policy in just a bit. But give me a minute to savor the political implications.

Republican efforts to regain control of Congress have rested almost entirely on blaming Joe Biden for inflation — and gas prices in particular.

Did Donald Trump, who is still the dominant figure in the G.O.P., attempt to overturn a legitimate election? Gas is over $5 a gallon! Are Republican judges and state legislators taking away rights women have had for decades? Gas is $5 a gallon!

Now the party’s main election plank — pretty much their only election plank — is being sawed off at the base. I’ve been wondering what they’ll do. After spending many months doing all they can to dumb down the debate, Republicans will have a hard time suddenly pivoting to nuanced arguments about headline numbers versus underlying inflation.

So far, their main response seems to be to ignore the inflation slowdown and hope voters don’t notice. Here, for example, is Mehmet Oz, running to be a Pennsylvania senator, on Thursday:

Has this man visited a gas station near his New Jersey home lately?

When — I’m pretty sure that’s a “when,” not an “if” — official data also shows a sharp decline in inflation, my guess is that we’ll see denial supplemented by conspiracy theories: claims that the Biden administration is faking the numbers or somehow manipulating the commodity markets.

Should Democrats emphasize the good news on inflation and mock their opponents’ doomsaying? Yes! Any Democratic politician who responds to falling energy and food prices with a discourse about transitory versus underlying inflation should be in a different business.

Policymakers, however — which in this case basically means the Federal Reserve — are in a different business, and they should respond to the good inflation news by keeping calm and carrying on.

Many fashionable economic concepts have failed the test of time, but the concept of core inflation — distinguishing between volatile prices, like food and energy, and slower-moving prices that have a lot of inertia — has been highly successful since the economist Robert Gordon introduced it in the 1970s. Time and again, the Fed has steered through crises by ignoring critics who wanted it to panic over blips in inflation caused by temporary jumps in commodity prices.

Now, defining core inflation has gotten harder in the Covid era, because just excluding food and energy seems inadequate at a time when wild swings in things like used car prices and shipping costs have also driven fluctuations in the rate of inflation. At the moment, however, every measure of underlying inflation I’m aware of, from traditional core to measures that exclude any large price changes and changes in labor costs, points to unacceptably high underlying inflation.

So why is inflation coming down? Biden administration policy — releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, urging gas stations to pass on declines in wholesale prices, efforts to unsnarl supply chains — may have contributed. But the main story is likely a global economic slowdown: America probably isn’t in a recession, but Europe probably is, China remains hobbled by its zero-Covid policy and so on.

All of which has remarkably little bearing on appropriate U.S. policy. The Fed’s strategy is to bring underlying inflation down by using interest rate hikes to cool off the economy. Despite Friday’s hot labor market report, I have no doubt that this strategy will eventually work. But the good news we’re about to get about short-term inflation isn’t evidence that the strategy has already worked, and alas (I’m usually a monetary dove), it offers no justification for a pivot toward easier money.

Does this mean that inflation is going to pop right back up again? Not necessarily. The Fed’s efforts probably will bring underlying inflation down over the next few months, so that by the time the transitory good news from gas prices fades out, it may be replaced by more permanent good news.

In any case, for the moment, inflation is headed down, no doubt to the great dismay of politicians who were counting on gas prices to deliver a red wave in November. Pass the popcorn.",1,[],[],"['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden']"

Our intelligence services.

Epstein ran a honeypot to compromise powerful men for Israel.  He wasn’t sexually trafficking girls for shits and giggles.  He was sexually trafficking girls to get compromising evidence to compel powerful men.

Again, our intelligence services.

OK.  But if they had video of him fucking underage girls he would do what he was told.  Think Bill Clinton and his many trips on Lolita express to rape island with Epstein.

&gt; I think you are wildly under estimating the power that a billionaire can wield in the US. Money brings immunity.

That’s obviously the case for Wexner.  Given his work with Bronfman to bankroll Epstein you would think he’d be in a deep dark cell getting tortured.  But he’s immune.  I like how the whole disgusting thing was funded with lingerie and booze.  Fitting.

&gt; How do you think Epstein got to where he was? Easy. Epstein had a lot of rich friends that provided Epstein money and protection.

Friends?  I’d expect they had a firm grip on his short hairs too.  Where were Epstein’s “friends” when he was suicided?  Who knows but I’m sure they were breathing a sigh of relief.

&gt; I’d love to know what Bill Clinton was forced to do after being compromised.

So nothing. Your conspiracy completely lacks an actual action.

&gt; Trump wasn’t Epstein’s friend.

[Trump was friend's with Epstein.](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-epstein-friendship-timeline-history-2019-7)

&gt; Trump told New York Magazine in 2002 that he had known Epstein for 15 years, suggesting they met around 1987. In the profile, Trump said Epstein was a ""lot of fun"". He also said Epstein liked beautiful women as much as he did, and that many of them were on the ""younger side"". The pair are seen here in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1992.

Who masterminded Epstein's suicide? Well, based on a 20 year history of working together to score the ""ladies"" (girls)... being in power when Epstein was killed...

If Epstein didn't kill Epstein...

Then it was Trump.",2,[],[],['Bill Clinton']

In this case, the CIA did not start those revolutions.

Revolutions start themselves... and in the current world, as soon as that happens a power vacuum appears.

Neighboring countries, Russia, the US, and China rush in to fill the vacuum.

That is how the world works.

&gt; Russia and Syria have been allies for decades. It’s us arming islamic extremists and invading Syria that is new. Ignoring the reality of how we use violence makes your propaganda too transparent and shallow.

See... I know that is not true.

What Russia and Syria call ""terrorists"" are groups like the Free Syrian Army. The US does fund groups like those.

One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. The US also funds the Kurds.

Russia funds the terrorist [Bashar al-Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad#:~:text=Bashar%20Hafez%20al%2DAssad%20(Arabic,Arab%20Socialist%20Ba'ath%20Party.).

See, Russian trolls are easy to identify. No one in the US really thinks about Syria. Russian trolls think a lot about Syria.

They try to derail random conversations into being about Syria... because they think that helps them.

We know what this warrant is about now.

56094,2022-08-11 16:55:31,Was There a Biden Boom?,,2022-08-11 16:58:15,AmericanPolitics,t3_wlwb3w,"If you have trouble with the *Times'* paywall, here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

Two weeks ago, I wrote a newsletter that I foolishly considered somewhat anodyne, not likely to get much reaction. It seemed probable that the initial estimate for G.D.P. growth in the second quarter would be negative and that many people would declare that this meant the United States was in a recession. So I spent some time pedantically explaining why we don’t actually use “two negative quarters” to define recessions and why, given other data, America probably wasn’t in one.

Silly me. I immediately received the biggest wave of hate mail I’ve gotten since the Iraq War, although it tapered off as many other economists and institutions declared that we weren’t in recession — not yet, anyway — and it pretty much vanished after Friday’s monster jobs report.

But absence of a recession aside, one question I get asked is what happened to the “Biden boom” I — and many other economists — predicted?

And the answer is, it happened! But Americans aren’t feeling it, and it’s worth asking why.

So, about that boom. Here’s a chart of jobs gained since Inauguration Day under Joe Biden and the Former Guy:

Obviously there was a plunge in employment in 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic forced the temporary shutdown of much of the economy. But one thing I haven’t seen widely noted is that job growth under Biden has been so fast that the economy added substantially more jobs in the past 18 months than were added in Trump’s first 37 months — that is, before the pandemic recession began.

I’m not saying that Biden deserves all the credit for this employment boom. When he took office, the U.S. economy was already in the process of recovering many of the jobs lost to the pandemic, although unemployment has fallen much faster than most forecasters were expecting in late 2020. But it’s kind of a moot point, anyway: Presidents often, dare I say usually, receive credit or blame for economic developments that have little to do with their policies.

So why doesn’t Biden get credit for the Biden boom, which is a real thing? Part of the answer is that people may not know about it. Some polling suggests that the public may not be aware that we’ve been creating jobs at all, let alone at a record pace. And we’re in a partisan environment where politicians — let’s not bothsides this, right-wing politicians — can make obviously false assertions and have their supporters believe them. The other day Trump told a crowd that gas in California costs $8.25 a gallon, and nobody laughed. (It was actually $5.43 at the time.)

Yet there has, of course, been a genuine dark side to the Biden boom: inflation. And people really dislike inflation. They would probably dislike it even if their incomes were keeping up. They definitely dislike it when prices are rising faster than wages, so the purchasing power of their income falls.

And inflation has, in fact, been outpacing wages since Biden took office; employment may be way up, but the real wages of those with jobs are down. We can argue about whether this episode is bad enough to justify the extreme negativity of public opinion about Biden and his economy, but it’s certainly a bad thing.

But what accounts for the inflation? That’s a huge subject, with scores if not hundreds of dueling studies, but there’s one fairly simple point that I think is clear: The inflation that people really hate, inflation that runs ahead of wage growth, is overwhelmingly a result of forces that were outside the control of the Biden administration, or any U.S. policymaker.

The Federal Reserve, which usually runs U.S. macroeconomic policy — the White House sometimes matters, but most of the time it’s the Fed’s show — has long made use of the concept of “core” inflation: inflation excluding volatile components, typically food and energy. The idea is that core inflation gives a better picture than the overall number of whether the economy is running too hot. In the post-pandemic era, with wild swings in things like the price of used cars, there have been questions about whether traditional core inflation excludes enough stuff. But for today’s purposes, I’ll stick with the traditional definition.

The big critique of Bidenomics, which has a lot of justification, is that big spending last year produced too much of a Biden boom, which led to a rise in core inflation; now the Fed has no choice but to squeeze the economy with higher interest rates until underlying inflation comes down.

But this policy mistake, if that’s what it was, has little to do with the reasons Americans are unhappy despite the jobs boom.

Here’s a comparison of two definitions of real wages for nonsupervisory workers since Biden took office. (I look at this type of worker because it’s a better indicator than the overall average of what’s happening to the working class.)

The lower line shows wages adjusted for overall consumer prices and tells us what we already know: Inflation has run faster than wage growth, so real wages are significantly down. The upper line, however, adjusts only for core prices, and it’s basically flat.

I’m sure this will be misinterpreted, no matter what I say, but I’m not saying that Americans should care only about core inflation: What matters for families is the cost of living, in all its components. What the chart does show, however, is that the component of inflation that upsets Americans most — inflation faster than wage growth — is overwhelmingly a result of forces, like the prices of globally traded commodities, that weren’t driven by U.S. economic policy.

In other words, the reasons people feel so bad about the U.S. economy have a lot to do with events outside U.S. control.

That won’t stop voters from punishing Democrats for inflation, although the odds are that over the next few months we’ll see a reversal of what happened over the past year and a half: Job growth will probably slow, but many prices will come down, especially gasoline, which dropped to an average of about $4 a gallon on Tuesday.

Anyway, the Biden boom was real. It just got overshadowed by inflation, much of which had nothing to do with U.S. policy.",1,[],[],['Joe Biden']

56222,2022-08-15 20:39:24,Trump’s latest eruption underscores the danger of a GOP House,,2022-08-15 20:40:28,AmericanPolitics,t3_wpa9go,"If you have trouble with WaPo's paywall, here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

Donald Trump spent the weekend raging at the FBI for searching his Mar-a-Lago resort, which he depicted as a “break in” and an “ABUSE,” while charging that the documents recovered there might have been a “plant.” He was joined by many Republicans, who widely denounced the search as a “witch hunt” or political “persecution.”

The apparent position of Republicans loyal to Trump is that any law enforcement activity targeting him is by definition illegitimate, no matter how grave the suspected activity. So a GOP-controlled House next year would likely undermine investigations into Trump any way it can, regardless of what is learned about Trump in the interim.

But the precise nature of this threat is poorly understood. While many have noted that a GOP House could stage phony Benghazi-like hearings, there’s another possibility: using specific parliamentary tools to, in essence, defund the investigators.

Such a tactic could badly complicate efforts to hold Trump accountable and could lead to government shutdowns and other chaos. The prospect is even more dire when you consider that a GOP House would contain a large faction of feral Trumpists who see making Trump untouchable by the law as their highest calling.

Democrats tell me they’ve begun to examine a range of tools Republicans could employ in such a situation, in part to prepare for a worst-case scenario. The specifics of this show that the GOP rallying around Trump right now could have appalling real-world consequences later.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), for example, has been looking at ways Republicans might attack the salaries of law enforcement officials deemed enemies of Trump.

“They want to ensure that Trump is above the law,” Beyer told me in a statement, noting that he expects a GOP House to coalesce around the position that anyone in law enforcement “who poses a threat to Trump must be deterred, blocked, punished, or fired.”

Note that some House Republicans such as Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) and Lauren Boebert (Colo.) have already called for defunding the FBI. Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has telegraphed never-ending investigations into Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department, in retaliation for any activity that involves Trump.

Even an extreme GOP House would be very unlikely to totally disband the FBI, and an endless Benghazi-like circus would be harassing but not debilitating. But another threat takes the form of a parliamentary maneuver.

Beyer points out that a GOP House majority could reinstate the so-called Holman Rule. This obscure rule — which Republicans revived last time they held the majority, until the Democratic majority ended it — would allow Republicans to use spending bills to try to slash the salary of specific federal officials or eliminate blocks of federal employees, and thus specific programs.

In a little-noticed aside, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) recently floated this idea, without detail. So it’s easy to see this rule being used as a mechanism to try to eliminate Garland’s salary, or the salaries of FBI officials overseeing an investigation involving Trump (or, if this happens, Justice Department officials prosecuting him).

Republicans could also attempt to defund any investigations into Trump, or even defund probes and prosecutions relating to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. They could do this without the more improbable act of defunding the whole FBI.

Such an effort, of course, would not pass the Senate (if Democrats hold it) and would never get signed by President Biden. But it’s obvious Trump loyalists in the House will force showdowns over this, and if the GOP majority is narrow, those loyalists might be more empowered to succeed.

“I have no doubt whatsoever that they would use the threat of government shutdowns and debt ceiling breaches,” said Beyer, who predicted “some of the worst attacks on the rule of law this country has ever seen.”

Other Democrats also fear this. Rep. Gerry Connolly (Va.) suggested in a statement that Republicans who are “all too willing to do Trump’s bidding” will weaponize the Holman Rule. And Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (Md.) said they will “use the levers of government to target, harass, and defund.”

In his weekend eruption, Trump raged every which way that the FBI’s search warrant amounted to jackbooted tyranny. Tellingly, he’s kept this up even after the warrant’s release revealed that officials feared violations of three federal statutes — and after we’ve learned the warrant was pursued partly based on information from Trump’s own aides.

And Trump has kept it up after we learned that numerous highly classified documents probably containing sensitive national security secrets actually were recovered at Mar-a-Lago.

We don’t know whether Trump will be accused of crimes or face prosecution for anything involving Jan. 6. But for now, with many Republicans (though not all) keeping up that Trumpian drumbeat even after the Mar-a-Lago search did retrieve ultra-sensitive documents, here’s the reality: For MAGA loyalists, Trump is above the law.

Given that this crew might soon wield more control over the House, do you doubt that maintaining absolute impunity for Trump will be among their highest missions, no matter how much chaos it unleashes?",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

56719,2022-08-29 16:28:15,NATIONAL DEBT," 

On Thursday August 25, 2022 America's national debt hit the staggering total combined amount of $30.82 trillion.

Since President Joe Biden was inaugurated into office a little more than nineteen months ago, the democrats in congress have increased the total combined national debt by **more than $3 trillion:**

Date              Debt Held by the Public        Intragovernmental Holdings      Total Public Debt Outstanding

01/20/2021    21,636,823,777,934.20         6,115,072,458,480.57                **27,751,896,236,414.77**  
08/25/2022    24,170,525,091,479.93         6,653,855,517,282.95                **30,824,380,608,762.88**

In this time period, the debt has increased precisely $3,072,484,372,348.11, and worst of all, almost all of this increase is debt held by the public which has been borrowed from foreign governments like the communist Chinese, and printed by the Federal Reserve Bank, significantly devaluing the precious U.S. dollar.

This is an absolutely mind-blowing increase of $5.28 billion each and every single day.

And given that true economic recovery appears to be nowhere in sight and the federal reserve continues to endlessly monetize the debt and pump countless trillions into the markets via quantitative easing, it is pretty much a certainly that the next three trillion dollars of debt will be accumulated before we know it within the next year and a half, or even less.",2022-08-29 17:22:29,AmericanPolitics,t3_x0t2kg,"Wrong on so many points... as usual.

And given that true economic recovery appears to be nowhere in sight and the federal reserve continues to endlessly monetize the debt and pump countless trillions into the markets via quantitative easing, it is pretty much a certainly that the next three trillion dollars of debt will be accumulated before we know it within the next year and a half, or even less.",2022-08-29 19:02:58,AmericanPolitics,t3_x0t2kg,[Narrative Techniques of Fear Mongering.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40971980),2,[],['Joe Biden'],[]

How many US citizens realize that US States' retirement funds are beholden to Russia?  That US politicians welcomed Russian investment?  But wait.  There's more.

The vehicle Russian-US politicians use is detailed below.  Every time you see a word related to ""corporate,"" replace it with a word to mean ""Russian.""

It's probable that Russian money/investment is littered throughout the country, because it's now invisible to the public, private, hidden crimes of abuse.  Cog dis is a mental roadblock to accepting that Russia is purchasing our government, piece at a time.  It's simply unthinkable, but the facts remain.  The investigative rule is to...

*Follow the money.*

  &amp;nbsp;

**Citizens United v. FEC**

The ""corporations are people, too"" ruling completely ignores that every US citizen member of all corporations already has full and unfettered First Amendment rights, their freedom to vote, campaign contribution limits, - freedoms of speech, religion and and assembly, equal to every other citizen.

The Citizens United decision is a force multiplier, giving members of corporations additional and unlimited voting powers (direct influence of and purchase of campaigns/candidates/incumbents) and unlimited power to negate the will of the people.  The Citizens U decision transforms corporations and PACs into de facto participants in government, not accountable to the people, unelected, unlimited and invisible in their power and tyranny.

Who holds them accountable to the people?  Certainly not their corrupt, governmental beneficiaries.

And now, the Supreme Court has ruled that dark money sources may be hidden, even if it's from *foreign* sources, in effect, *inviting* foreign interference.  If sources and amounts can't be publicly vetted, the funds can come from anywhere.

https://www.vox.com/2021/7/1/22559318/supreme-court-americans-for-prosperity-bonta-citizens-united-john-roberts-donor-disclosure

The recent rumblings to prevent members of Congress from investing in companies affected by their votes will do nothing to correct this situation.  It is needed legislation, but dark money will still find an avenue to political pockets.

  &amp;nbsp;

As the GQP busies itself turning the US into Russia, we need to follow the Russian money being used to do it.

Both in investments and in terms of kompromat.

56753,2022-08-30 16:28:01,Why Student Debt Relief Isn’t Elitist,,2022-08-30 16:28:51,AmericanPolitics,t3_x1nius,"If you have trouble with the *Times'* paywall, here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

Embarrassing admission: I have been watching the TV show “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.” I’m not, in general, a fan of the superhero genre; but after “Orphan Black” I’ll watch anything starring Tatiana Maslany.

Anyway, one of the show’s plot points is that the title character is reluctant to reveal her superpowers. Why? Among other things, she’s worried (correctly, it turns out) that once people know what she can do she’ll have a hard time paying off her student loans.

I don’t think the writers were trying to make a political statement. They were just acknowledging the pervasiveness of student debt — and anxiety about student debt — in modern America. And that pervasiveness is why Republicans’ attacks on President Biden’s debt-relief policy — which they generally portray as a giveaway either to privileged elites or to lazy spendthrifts — are likely to fall flat.

Let’s talk about the numbers. The Biden administration says that its plan will provide relief to as many as 43 million Americans. That’s a lot of people, not a small, cosseted elite. In particular, data from the New York Fed say that more than 12 million Americans in their 30s — more than a quarter of that age group — still have unpaid student debt.

What this means is that even if you subscribe to the Trump diner theory of politics — according to which the only voters who matter are blue-collar guys wearing baseball caps — you should be aware that some of those guys probably took out loans to attend trade schools or community colleges, all too often getting nothing but debt in return. Even among those who didn’t take out student loans, many probably have children, siblings, cousins or friends who did. So the Biden plan will touch many people.

In short, student debt relief isn’t some kind of niche elite concern; it’s a broad, one might even say populist, issue. Initial polling on the Biden plan is somewhat mixed, with an Emerson College survey showing much stronger support than a CBS/YouGov survey. Even the latter survey, however, finds a majority of Americans approving of the plan; it even finds much less opposition among noncollege whites than you might have expected given that group’s general disapproval of all things Biden.

The other prong of the right-wing response involves invoking personal responsibility — in effect, portraying the recipients of debt relief as welfare queens. Republican efforts on that front have, however, been extraordinarily tone-deaf.

Just on general political principles, telling tens of millions of Americans that they’re lazy and irresponsible — that they’re all, as Ted Cruz put it, like a “slacker barista” who wasted years “studying completely useless things” — seems … not smart. To be brutally honest, that sort of caricature may have worked for Republicans when the insults were directed at urban Black people. But it’s likely to backfire when we’re talking about a broad spectrum of Americans who were just trying to move up in the world.

Furthermore, many of the most prominent critics of debt relief are almost comically out of touch, hypocritical, or both. Actually, scratch the “almost.”

For example, Marco Rubio has proudly declared that he paid off all his student debt — after being elected to the Senate and getting a book contract. Why can’t everyone do that?

On the hypocrisy front, the White House is having a field day mocking Republican members of Congress whose businesses received debt forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program. It’s true that debt relief for employers who maintained their work forces in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic was built into that program; it’s also true that later research suggests that only about a quarter of P.P.P. funds supported jobs that would otherwise have disappeared. The rest was, in effect, a giveaway to business owners.

More generally, it’s hard to take lectures on personal responsibility seriously when they come from a movement full of people — from Donald Trump, famous for stiffing his contractors, on down — who have long refused to pay money they owe. It’s hard to beat the spectacle of Stephen Moore, who Donald Trump tried to appoint to the Federal Reserve, calling people who don’t pay their debts “deadbeats”; after all, Moore’s nomination failed in part because it turned out that he had refused to pay his ex-wife $300,000 in child support and alimony.

Now, none of this means that the Biden plan should be exempt from criticism, although the vehemence with which some centrists have attacked it remains puzzling. Above all, the plan offers some one-time relief, but it doesn’t solve the underlying problem that led to all that student debt — which isn’t a proliferation of slacker baristas; it’s a society that demands educational credentials for many jobs without making education affordable.

The thing is, Biden tried to address this underlying problem; free community college was part of his original Build Back Better proposal. But he couldn’t get it through Congress. He is, however, offering some real help to millions of Americans — and Republicans clearly have no idea how to respond.",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

As Donald Trump’s legal travails deepen, a strange split-screen effect has taken hold throughout the GOP. On one screen, Republicans are increasingly anxious about revelations involving Trump, while concocting ever more inventive ways to achieve distance from them.

On the other, GOP candidates in crucial midterm contests are, if anything, getting more Trumpy. They’re not just aggressively defending Trump; they’re also enthusiastically embracing the many pathologies he brought to our politics, and even imitating his mannerisms.

This captures an essential tension about this moment. Many Republicans apparently remain deeply convinced that Trump and his preoccupations are an indispensable source of political energy for their 2022 campaigns. Yet coming revelations about Trump might keep rendering that energy more toxic in swing states and districts.

Two useful reports — one in Politico, the other in the New York Times — provide new information that illuminates that tension. Politico details “growing angst and concern” among Republicans about Trump’s ever-ballooning role in news cycles.

Some Republicans are urging the party to pivot away from defending Trump, Politico notes, to change the subject back to issues such as inflation. One GOP fundraiser describes the party’s mood about Trump as “enormous frustration.”

Republicans have adopted several strategies after the release of the redacted affidavit for the FBI’s Mar-a-Lago search, which deepened our understanding of Trump’s misconduct and potential crimes associated with hoarding highly classified documents.

Some Republicans are blaming the media for hyping the revelations, per Politico. Others insist there’s something vaguely amiss about the timing of the search. Still others say the documents aren’t harboring serious secrets, which is contradicted by already-known facts.

But the responses mostly have a halfhearted quality. Among those Republicans, at least, gone is the full-throated rage that initially treated Trump as uniformly a victim and the search as wholly illegitimate.

Why? Well, as the Times piece documents, Trump is again a big story on terms unfavorable to Republicans. The political dynamic has shifted amid numerous factors: Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices overturning Roe v. Wade, revelations about Trump’s effort to destroy our democracy and, now, the drumbeat of devastating facts about his harboring of state secrets.

While holding the House will still be tough for Democrats, it’s now in play, and keeping the Senate is very plausible. As Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg tells the Times, the combination of Republicans initially running “toward MAGA” and Trump’s reemergence with a vengeance have given Democrats “more ammunition to label their candidates as extreme.”

Many of the aforementioned “frustrated” Republicans appear to agree. But here’s the rub: Some GOP candidates have a different theory of the case. They genuinely appear to see Trump and Trumpism as key sources of political energy and inspiration.

Take Blake Masters, the GOP nominee for Senate in Arizona. Masters is under fire for blaming racial diversity at the Federal Reserve for economic woes. Now, Masters has responded with a video that seems designed to capture a kind of unadulterated Trumpism:

Note that Masters says “fake news!” with a bombastic vehemence that appears to consciously imitate Trump. And Masters attacks Vice President Harris with the ugly claim that she is “so incompetent she can’t even get a sentence out.”

That’s gutter trolling, but it’s of interest. While Masters has tried to selectively sanitize his positions on abortion and the 2020 election, here he’s working overtime to capture the spirit and essence of Trump’s sheer abusiveness. It’s as though going all-in on such unapologetic derangement is itself a selling point that displays resolve and fight against, well, whoever gets triggered by it.

It all has the feel of the geek who tries to stride into the school cafeteria with the swagger of a jock, but trips over his own feet. As Sam Adler-Bell documents, Masters is crafting a brand of Trumpism that’s nerdy and hyper-intellectualized but retains its dark hatreds of all manner of leftist enemies. In that video Masters attempts this to particularly ill effect.

Or take Doug Mastriano, the GOP candidate for governor in Pennsylvania. He continues to embrace insurrectionist lies about 2020 and talks only to right-wing media sources. When an old Army War College faculty photo surfaced of him in a Confederate uniform, his adviser was brashly unapologetic and blamed the left for trying to “erase history.” Mastriano is set to campaign with Trump.

And Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor of Arizona, is still running down rabbit holes in a never-ending chase after crackpot conspiracy theories about 2020. Lake depicted the Mar-a-Lago search as a sign the country has succumbed to totalitarianism and jackbooted tyranny.

GOP strategist Liam Donovan notes that such candidates are motivated by different levels of sincerity in their devotion to the Trumpist faith, but all seek to draw from it a political “spark” that replicates Trump’s successes.

“So much of it is an attitudinal thing,” Donovan told me. “So much of it is a sneer.”

Many GOP politicians, Donovan continued, grasp the true essence of Trump’s most important innovation.

“Trump realized that having the right enemies is perhaps the most important thing to the GOP base,” Donovan told me. These candidates are seeking to “emulate” those tendencies, “even if it’s sort of a pale imitation.”

It remains to be seen how heavy an albatross Trump will prove to be for Republicans. But one thing is clear: Many GOP candidates appear committed to requiring the party to find out.",1,[],[],['Donald Trump']

&gt; Thirteen times Biden called out the Trumpists who have seized hold of one of America&amp;#039;s two great political parties-in just about the most unsparing terms a President has ever used for political opponents.

&gt; How dare Joe Biden say such nasty things about them for doing so? These howls of complaint might have been fun to listen to from the folks who routinely savage Biden as a wild-eyed socialist out to destroy freedom itself, if what they themselves were doing to the country were not so deadly serious.

57105,2022-09-13 15:20:40,Ukraine Deflates MAGA Macho Myths,,2022-09-13 15:21:38,AmericanPolitics,t3_xdadoe,"If you have trouble with the *Times'* paywall, here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

On Aug. 29 Tucker Carlson of Fox News attacked President Biden’s policy on Ukraine, asserting among other things: “By any actual reality-based measure, Vladimir Putin is not losing the war in Ukraine. He is winning the war in Ukraine.” Carlson went on, by the way, to assert that Biden is supporting Ukraine only because he wants to destroy the West.

Carlson’s timing was impeccable. Just a few days later, a large section of the Russian front near Kharkiv was overrun by a Ukrainian attack. It’s important to note that Putin’s forces weren’t just pushed back; they appear to have been routed. As the independent Institute for the Study of War reported, the Russians were driven into a “panicked and disorderly retreat,” leaving behind “large amounts of equipment and supplies that Ukrainian forces can use.”

The Russian collapse seemed to validate analyses by defense experts who have been saying for months that Western weapons have been shifting the military balance in Ukraine’s favor, that Putin’s army is desperately short on quality manpower and that it has been degraded by attrition and missile attacks on its rear areas. These analyses suggested that Russian forces might eventually reach a breaking point, although few expected that point to come so soon and so dramatically.

To be fair to Carlson and other right-wing cheerleaders for Putin, they aren’t the only people clinging to delusions of Russian success. There’s a whole school of self-styled “realists” who considered Ukrainian resistance to Russia futile and who, despite the failure of Putin’s initial assault, have spent the past six months calling on Ukraine to make big concessions to supposedly superior Russian power.

But there’s something special about the MAGA embrace of the mystique of Russian might: a worldview that equates tough-guy swagger with effectiveness. This worldview has warped the right’s perception not just of the Russian Army but also of how to deal with many other issues. And it’s worth asking where it comes from.

Many Republicans have admired Putin for a long time — even before Donald Trump took over the G.O.P. Back in 2014, for example, Rudy Giuliani said of Putin, “That’s what you call a leader.” And Trump continued to praise Putin even after he invaded Ukraine.

So it’s not hard to see where the MAGA right’s admiration for Putinism comes from. After all, Putin’s Russia is autocratic, brutal and homophobic, with a personality cult built around its ruler. What’s not to like?

Yet admiring a regime’s values needn’t mean having faith in its military prowess. As a center-left advocate of a strong social safety net — or, as Republicans would say, a Marxist (which, of course, I’m not) — I think highly of Nordic welfare states like Denmark. But I have no opinion whatsoever about the effectiveness of Denmark’s army (yes, it has one).

On the right, however, approval of authoritarian regimes is all bound up with assertions about their military prowess. For example, last year Ted Cruz tweeted about a video comparing scenes of a tough-looking Russian soldier with a shaved head with a U.S. Army recruiting video featuring a female corporal raised by two mothers. “Perhaps a woke, emasculated military is not the best idea,” opined Cruz.

Actually, the U.S. military is sort of woke, in the sense that it is highly diverse and inclusive, encourages independent thinking and initiative on the part of junior officers and is, at the higher levels, quite intellectual.

The Russian Army, on the other hand, definitely isn’t woke. Conscripts face brutal hazing. According to Mark Hertling, a former commander of U.S. forces in Europe, it’s riddled with “mafialike” corruption and its officers are terrible.

The broader point is that modern wars aren’t won by looking tough. Courage — which the Ukrainians have shown in almost inconceivable abundance — is essential; but it doesn’t have much to do with bulging biceps. And bravery must go hand in hand with being smart and flexible, qualities the Russian Army evidently lacks.

Did I mention that women make up more than a fifth of Ukraine’s military?

The import of all these factors should be obvious. Modern war is like the modern economy (with an additional element of sheer terror, but still): Success depends more on skill, knowledge and openness to ideas than on muscle power. But the MAGA ethos is all bound up with exaltation of tough talk and denigration of expertise. (Prosecute Anthony Fauci!) The American right needed to see Putin as a leader made powerful by his rejection of liberal values; admitting that Russia has proved that it isn’t a great power would call the whole MAGA philosophy into question.

The result is that the war, while it is of course overwhelmingly a fight for Ukrainian freedom, has also, weirdly, become a front in America’s cultural and political wars.

There’s growing speculation about what will happen inside Russia if the invasion of Ukraine ends in outright defeat. But you also have to wonder how the U.S. right will handle the revelation that sometimes tough guys finish last.",4,[],[],['Donald Trump']

If a Republican governor with presidential ambitions were to get nabbed misusing federal funds in the quest to “own the libs,” would this be politically problematic for him at all? Or would the flagrant willingness to abuse the levers of power toward that hallowed end be seen as an undiluted positive by the voters and media elites he cares about?

This question is likely to be answered soon, now that the Treasury Department inspector general is investigating whether Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) improperly drew from a fund created by the 2021 covid-19 rescue act to help states recover from the pandemic when he flew migrants to Martha’s Vineyard.

The flights — which originated in Texas — were paid for by interest earned on that covid money. The state of Florida budgeted a total of $12 million of that interest for a program for transporting migrants, around $600,000 of which reportedly funded the flights to Martha’s Vineyard. DeSantis has threatened to pay for future flights with remaining funds.

But now Treasury’s inspector general is examining whether this use of covid-related funding for immigration purposes is improper. Under federal law, misuse would mean the state owes an equivalent amount back to the federal government, according to the office of Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who requested the probe.

Follow Greg Sargent's opinionsFollow

This, all because DeSantis badly wanted to play catch-up with fellow Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who’s basking in Fox News love for busing thousands of migrants to other liberal strongholds.

The whole saga has devolved into an utter farce. The $12 million fund was specifically earmarked for the transport of migrants “from this state,” which apparently required DeSantis to fly the migrants to Florida first before heading on to Massachusetts. The program has been hit with a lawsuit alleging the migrants were misled in a pageant of slapstick buffoonery.

The stunt’s underlying rationale was nonsense. The flights were supposed to rub liberals’ faces in the burden that border states bear due to allegedly permissive policy on asylum seekers, but blue states are already home to a large share of migrants awaiting asylum hearings.

In short, DeSantis has “owned the libs” by redirecting money earmarked for covid recovery to a political gesture that’s entirely empty, has no real underlying rationale and was manufactured as cruelty theater for the Fox News primary electorate.

Yet it could get even more absurd. If Treasury’s inspector general were to find the expenditure is unlawful, it could mean not only the end of the flights, as Markey’s office notes, but also that this lib-owning exercise could end up owning Florida taxpayers instead.

Let’s say that does happen. Would it hurt DeSantis politically? Probably not.

One main DeSantis selling point for 2024 is that he’s the perfect vehicle to co-opt the MAGA energies unleashed by Donald Trump. This stunt signaled to Republican voters that he would be as cruel as Trump to migrants. DeSantis has also carefully displayed his willingness to use state power to target other assorted leftist enemies, such as “woke” corporations and teachers who say too much about sex and gender in the classroom.

Such displays also seem aimed at GOP and conservative elites who are looking for someone to harness those energies without Trump’s political self-sabotage. There’s an elite intellectual component to this as well: As Jonathan Chait reports, the most recent National Conservatism Conference featured leading conservative thinkers gushing about the DeSantis governorship as the model for a future authoritarian right wing presidency.

Chait captures a striking moment from the conference, in which DeSantis’s chief propagandist, Christina Pushaw, describes the marginalization of independent media organizations as a crucial task ahead for this budding authoritarian right, which entails destroying their reputation as objective:

&gt; This reputation, she believes, comes from the perception that they have access to both parties, so the correct response by Republicans is to freeze out the mainstream media. “If they have no access to any Republican elected officials, they are seen for what they are,” she proposed. Pushaw stressed that Republicans should not even concede that reporters are journalists at all.

When DeSantis signed onerous state voting restrictions, he gave exclusive access to Fox News. And when those migrant planes landed in Martha’s Vineyard, video of this glorious event was promptly leaked to Fox, apparently by DeSantis’s staff.

DeSantis does this not only to pump this thrilling content directly into the veins of the national GOP electorate, but also to send the message that he is forcefully marginalizing the liberal media in the process.

Central to this politics is the depiction of all our institutions — the news media, universities, our elections, the immigration bureaucracy, the “deep state” — as irredeemably corrupted by leftism, justifying the use of expansive state power from the right in response.

So if DeSantis did abuse federal funds to depict migrants as a diseased other that would inevitably be hated wherever they were dropped off — and to provoke liberal outrage in response, never mind that the outrage was about how the migrants were abused by DeSantis — well, so what? Using pandemic money in a way that got a few pointy-headed federal bureaucrats upset just shows he’s willing to do what it takes to fight the enemy.

It seems highly likely that if Treasury’s inspector general finds that federal dollars were misused, DeSantis would just wear it as a badge of honor.",5,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---

Nobody knows for sure what will happen in the midterm elections. But if Republicans take one or both houses of Congress, the most important question will be one that is getting hardly any public attention: What will the Biden administration do when the G.O.P. threatens to blow up the world economy by refusing to raise the debt limit?

In particular, will Democrats be prepared to take the extraordinary actions the situation will demand, doing whatever it takes to avoid being blackmailed?

Notice that I said “when,” not “if.” After Republicans took the House in 2010, they quickly weaponized the debt limit against the Obama administration, using it to extract spending cuts they couldn’t have achieved through normal legislative means. And that was a pre-MAGA G.O.P., one that for the most part didn’t deny the legitimacy of the president and didn’t make excuses for violent insurrections.

In fact, I wonder whether Republicans will even seriously try to extract concessions this time around, as opposed to creating chaos for its own sake.

Notice also that I said “blow up the world economy,” not merely hamstring the U.S. government. For the consequences of forcing a federal debt default, which is what refusing to raise the limit would do, would extend far beyond the operations of the federal government itself.

Let’s back up and talk about why any of this is an issue. U.S. law, for historical reasons, requires in effect that Congress vote on the budget twice. First, senators and representatives enact legislation that sets tax rates and authorizes spending. This legislation ends up determining the federal budget balance. But if we end up running a deficit, Congress must vote a second time, to authorize borrowing to cover that deficit.

It’s not clear that this procedure ever made sense. In any case, in modern times the debt limit empowers cowardly posturing: Politicians can claim to be for fiscal responsibility, refusing to vote for a higher debt limit, without specifying how the budget should be balanced.

And no, “we should eliminate wasteful spending” isn’t an honest answer. The federal government is basically a giant insurance company with an army: Spending is dominated by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the military, and voters want to maintain all of these programs. There’s surely waste in the government, as there is in any large organization, but even if we could somehow make that waste disappear, it wouldn’t do much to reduce the deficit.

Someone seriously worried about the deficit could call for higher taxes. After all, the U.S. tax burden is low compared with other wealthy countries. But Republicans aren’t going to go there.

Where will they go? There’s lots of evidence that Republicans will, if they can, try to use the debt limit to extort major cuts in Social Security and Medicare. They probably couldn’t pass such cuts — which would be deeply unpopular — through the normal legislative process, and they certainly wouldn’t have enough votes to override a Biden veto. But the idea would be to force Democrats into complicity, so that the public doesn’t realize who’s responsible for the pain.

And that’s a best-case scenario. As I said, the G.O.P. is far more radical now than it was more than a decade ago, and it might well be less interested in achieving policy goals than in blowing up the world economy on a Democratic president’s watch.

Why would refusing to raise the debt limit blow up the economy? In the modern world, U.S. debt plays a crucial role: It is the ultimate safe asset, easily converted into cash, and there are no good alternatives. If investors lose confidence that the U.S. government will honor its obligations, the resulting financial storm will make the recent chaos in Britain look like a passing shower.

So what should be done to avert this threat? If Republicans do gain control of one or both houses in November, Democrats should use the lame-duck session to enact a very large rise in the debt limit, enough to put the issue on ice for years. Republicans and pundits who don’t understand the stakes would furiously attack this move, but it would be far better than enabling extortion — and would probably be forgotten by the time of the 2024 election.

If for some reason Democrats don’t take this obvious step, the Biden administration should be prepared to turn to legal strategies for bypassing the debt limit. There appear to be several loopholes the administration could exploit — minting trillion-dollar platinum coins is the most famous, but there are others, like issuing bonds with no maturity date and hence no face value.

The Obama administration was unwilling to go any of these routes, largely, I think, because it believed that they would look gimmicky and undignified, and it preferred to seek compromise. But surely Democrats don’t need to worry about dignity when the other party is ruled by Donald Trump. And in any case, they’re now confronting opponents who aren’t just radical but also anti-democracy; no real compromise is possible.

Of course, none of this will be relevant if Democrats hold Congress. But they should prepare for the worst.",3,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---

If you aren’t feeling a sense of dread on the eve of the midterm elections, you haven’t been paying attention.

We can talk about the conventional stakes of these elections — their implications for economic policy, major social programs, environmental policy, civil liberties and reproductive rights. And it’s not wrong to have these discussions: Life will go on whatever happens on the political scene, and government policies will continue to have a big impact on people’s lives.

But I, at least, always feel at least a bit guilty when writing about inflation or the fate of Medicare. Yes, these are my specialties. Focusing on them, however, feels a bit like denial, or at least evasion, when the fundamental stakes right now are so existential.

Ten or 20 years ago, those of us who warned that the Republican Party was becoming increasingly extremist and anti-democracy were often dismissed as alarmists. But the alarmists have been vindicated every step of the way, from the selling of the Iraq war on false pretenses to the Jan. 6 insurrection.

Indeed, these days it’s almost conventional wisdom that the G.O.P. will, if it can, turn America into something like Viktor Orban’s Hungary: a democracy on paper, but an ethnonationalist, authoritarian one-party state in practice. After all, U.S. conservatives have made no secret about viewing Hungary as a role model; they have feted Orban and featured him at their conferences.

At this point, however, I believe that even this conventional wisdom is wrong. If America descends into one-party rule, it will be much worse, much uglier, than what we see in today’s Hungary.

Before I get there, a word about the role of conventional policy issues in these elections.

If Democrats lose one or both houses of Congress, there will be a loud chorus of recriminations, much of it asserting that they should have focused on kitchen table issues and not talked at all about threats to democracy.

I don’t claim any expertise here, but I would note that an incumbent president’s party almost always loses seats in the midterms. The only exception to that rule this century was in 2002, when George W. Bush was able to deflect attention from a jobless recovery by posing as America’s defender against terrorism. That record suggests, if anything, that Democrats should have talked even more about issues beyond economics.

I’d also say that pretending that this was an ordinary election season, where only economic policy was at stake, would have been fundamentally dishonest.

Finally, even voters who are more worried about paychecks and living costs than about democracy should nonetheless be very concerned about the G.O.P.’s rejection of democratic norms.

For one thing, Republicans have been open about their plan to use the threat of economic chaos to extract concessions they couldn’t win through the normal legislative process.

Also, while I understand the instinct of voters to choose a different driver if they don’t like where the economy is going, they should understand that this time, voting Republican doesn’t just mean giving someone else a chance at the wheel; it may be a big step toward handing the G.O.P. permanent control, with no chance for voters to revisit that decision if they don’t like the results.

Which brings me to the question of what a one-party America would look like.

As I said, it’s now almost conventional wisdom that Republicans are trying to turn us into Hungary. Indeed, Hungary provides a case study in how democracies can die in the 21st century.

But what strikes me, reading about Orban’s rule, is that while his regime is deeply repressive, the repression is relatively subtle. It is, as one perceptive article put it, “soft fascism,” which makes dissidents powerless via its control of the economy and the news media without beating them up or putting them in jail.

Do you think a MAGA regime, with or without Donald Trump, would be equally subtle? Listen to the speeches at any Trump rally. They’re full of vindictiveness, of promises to imprison and punish anyone — including technocrats like Anthony Fauci — the movement dislikes.

And much of the American right is sympathetic to, or at least unwilling to condemn, violence against its opponents. The Republican reaction to the attack on Paul Pelosi by a MAGA-spouting intruder was telling: Many in the party didn’t even pretend to be horrified. Instead, they peddled ugly conspiracy theories. And the rest of the party didn’t ostracize or penalize the purveyors of vile falsehoods.

In short, if MAGA wins, we’ll probably find ourselves wishing its rule was as tolerant, relatively benign and relatively nonviolent as Orban’s.

Now, this catastrophe doesn’t have to happen. Even if Republicans win big in the midterms, it won’t be the end for democracy, although it will be a big blow. And nothing in politics, not even a full descent into authoritarianism, is permanent.

On the other hand, even if we get a reprieve this week, the fact remains that democracy is in deep danger from the authoritarian right. America as we know it is not yet lost, but it’s on the edge.",6,[],[],"['Donald Trump', 'George W. Bush']"

After their party’s disappointing performance in the midterms, Republican elites seem to have decided that Donald Trump is their big problem. The Murdoch media empire has been trashing the former president. Many donors and operatives are reportedly rallying around Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. But Trump, who is widely expected to announce his 2024 presidential campaign on Tuesday, won’t go quietly.

Will Trump secure the nomination despite elite qualms? If he doesn’t, will a man who has never shown any loyalty to his party or, for that matter, anyone but himself, sabotage the G.O.P. out of spite? I don’t know more than anyone else who follows the news.

Let’s talk instead about how remarkable it is that someone like Trump managed to dominate one of America’s two major political parties and surely retains a substantial base.

I’m not talking about the fact that Trump holds what I consider reprehensible policy views or even the fact that he engaged in several acts, including an attempt to overturn a national election, that can reasonably be described as seditious. Clearly, most of the G.O.P. is OK with all of that.

I’m talking instead about the evident perception by many Republicans that Trump is a strong leader, when he is in reality extraordinarily weak.

Start with personal character — not my favorite subject (I’m much more comfortable talking about policy), but something that clearly matters when you’re choosing a commander in chief.

I don’t think it’s romanticizing the past to say that once upon a time politicians who sought the presidency had to appear, well, presidential. That is, they had to display gravitas and dignity; whatever their behavior behind closed doors, in public they had to appear mature and self-controlled.

Trump, however, comes across as 76 going on a very bratty 14. He veers, sometimes in consecutive sentences, between cringeworthy boasting (what kind of person describes himself as a stable genius?) and whining, between bombast and self-pity.

Beyond personal affect, what stands out about Trump’s time in office is his weakness, his inability to get things done.

On domestic policy, Trump ran in 2016 as a different kind of Republican, one who would break with the party’s tax-cutting, anti-government orthodoxy. Once in the White House, however, he was putty in Mitch McConnell’s hands. His only major domestic policy initiatives were a failed attempt to repeal Obamacare and a standard-issue G.O.P. tax cut for corporations and the wealthy.

What about his promises to invest in infrastructure? Nothing came of them: “It’s Infrastructure Week!” became a running joke.

On foreign policy, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un played Trump for a fool with empty reassurances about denuclearization. China’s Xi Jinping did much the same over trade, getting Trump to pause his tariff hikes in return for a promise to buy U.S. goods that proved entirely empty.

In short, Trump’s performance in office was feeble — especially compared with that of his successor.

President Biden didn’t get everything he wanted on domestic policy, but he did get a major infrastructure bill and, in the Inflation Reduction Act, both unprecedented spending to fight climate change and a significant strengthening of health care. And Democrats’ unexpectedly strong showing in the midterms probably ensures that these policy successes will endure.

Overseas, Biden assembled and held together a coalition in support of Ukraine that has enabled the invaded nation to resist Russia’s attack — a huge foreign-policy success reminiscent of America’s pre-Pearl Harbor role as the “arsenal of democracy.” And Biden’s China policy, centering on export restrictions designed to undermine China’s technological ambitions, is vastly more aggressive than anything Trump did, even if it hasn’t gotten nearly as much media attention.

Yet Biden is often portrayed as weak and out of it, while Trump was perceived by 90 percent of Republicans as a “strong leader” on the day he grudgingly left office. How is this possible?

The Trump personality cult may have been enabled in part by forces that go beyond politics. After all, we used to expect dignified behavior from captains of industry as well as politicians. But these days, perhaps because celebrity culture infects everything, business leaders are taken seriously even when they seem unable to refrain from flamboyant displays of ego and insecurity. (Cough. Elon Musk. Cough.)

Also, the Republican elites trying to distance themselves from Trump spent years fluffing his image. Until a few days ago Fox News, the main source of political information for much of the G.O.P. base, gave Trump the kind of hagiographic coverage you’d expect from state media in a dictatorship.

And Republican politicians, many of whom knew Trump for what he was, spent years praising him in language reminiscent of Politburo members praising the party chairman.

Now those same elites want to push Trump out of the picture. But while they may be able to deny him the nomination, they probably won’t be able to avoid paying a heavy price for their past cowardice.",9,[],[],['Donald Trump']

---

Democrats had far better midterms this year than they did in 2010. Still, with Republicans on the cusp of winning narrow control of the House, there’s unlikely to be major legislation passed over the next two years. So as was the case for President Barack Obama, President Biden’s legislative high-water mark will probably be a bill he got passed in his first two years. In that sense, the Inflation Reduction Act — which, despite its name, is mainly a climate and health care bill — is this administration’s equivalent of Obamacare.

Unlike Obamacare, however, the I.R.A. was barely mentioned on the campaign trail. In other words, it was a huge political success. And this success vindicated what we might call the new climate policy, which emphasizes carrots rather than sticks.

How so? Well, do you remember when progressives pushed for a Green New Deal? Conservatives bashed their ideas, portraying them as a plot to take away Americans’ pickup trucks and force them to eat soy burgers. Even centrist pundits now tend to talk about the Green New Deal as a leftist fantasy that never had a chance of happening.

But the truth is that Biden has basically passed a Green New Deal. True, he didn’t get the large-scale spending on families, especially children, that was in his original Build Back Better act. But he got most of the climate policy he wanted: Modelers have estimated that the Inflation Reduction Act will achieve about 80 percent of the greenhouse gas reductions that would have been achieved under Build Back Better.

And nobody noticed. Success!

To understand the nature of that success, we need to talk about a long-running debate over how to address climate change.

Pollution in general, including greenhouse gas emissions, is a prime example of what economists call a “negative externality” — a cost that individuals and companies impose on other people without paying the price themselves. When an economic activity like burning coal to produce electricity imposes negative externalities, people tend to do too much of it.

The textbook answer to pollution is for governments to impose a price on polluters, which can be achieved either by imposing a tax on emissions or by establishing a “cap and trade” system in which the private sector can buy or sell a limited number of emissions permits. We actually have a cap and trade system for emissions of sulfur dioxide, which helped contain the threat of acid rain; the House of Representatives passed cap and trade legislation for greenhouse gases back in 2009, only to see the bill die in the Senate. And many economists, including Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, have endorsed the idea of a carbon tax as the principal response to climate change.

But the economic case for making a carbon tax the centerpiece of climate policy is dubious, and the politics of tax-centered climate policy are hopeless.

On the economics: The world has changed immensely since the cap and trade bill failed in 2009, mainly thanks to incredible technological progress in renewable energy. Here are changes in the “levelized cost of energy” between 2009 and 2019, from Max Roser of Our World in Data:

The plunging costs of solar and wind power have greatly simplified the problem of getting to a low-emission economy. At this point it no longer appears that drastic reductions in emissions will require major changes in the way we live, which would be hard to achieve without something like a carbon tax. Instead, it’s mainly a matter of electrifying everything we can and generating that electricity from renewables, which means that green energy subsidies, as opposed to taxes, can do the job.

In fact, a carbon tax by itself would be the wrong policy even on purely economic grounds. While pollution is a negative externality, green energy appears to be characterized by positive externalities: an individual’s choice to drive an electric car or a power company’s decision to invest in renewables conveys benefits to others.

Partly, this reflects what appear to be steep learning curves for new energy technologies: The more people make use of these technologies, the better we get at them and the easier they will be to adopt.

And partly it reflects the fact that these technologies become more usable when many people use them: Electric cars become more attractive when there are many charging stations, which will materialize if many people drive electric cars.

There’s still a case for carbon taxes as part of a climate strategy, but there’s also a case to be made that we can achieve what we need to achieve without such taxes, simply by subsidizing green energy. In other words, by using carrots rather than sticks.

And that’s a good thing, because the politics of carbon taxes are poisonous. It’s not just an American thing, although we may be exceptional in the way energy policy gets caught up in the culture war — yes, right-wingers denounce concerns about the climate as “wokeness.” Even in France, energy taxes had to be canceled after violent protests from the “yellow vest” movement.

The politics of subsidies for green energy, however, are arguably much more positive. Instead of making it more expensive for people to do what they were doing before, the government is making it cheaper for them to do different things. And it doesn’t hurt that the administration can then boast about the jobs its strategy is creating in everything from battery manufacturing to solar-panel installation.

The job-creating effects of the Inflation Reduction Act probably didn’t have much effect in the midterms, although there has been a steady drumbeat of news reports about plans to open new factories in response. Maybe these benefits will matter more in 2024. For now, however, the point is that the Biden administration pushed through enormously consequential climate legislation without, as far as anyone can tell, paying any political price. That in itself is a major vindication of its strategy.",1,[],[],['Barack Obama']

All Elon provided was ""proof"" that Donald Trump and Biden's campaign requested removal of certain material from Twitter.

That is fine. A political campaign is allowed to request anything they like.

That isn't the government writing a law that restricts free speech.

Do you understand the difference?

&gt; 2-corporations are not private companies. 

It doesn't matter if it is a ""private company"" owned by select individuals or a ""public comapny"" owned by lots of smaller individuals.

[In the US, both institutions have the same right to freedom of speech.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC)

Having those same rights means that corporation has a right to say or not say anything it likes. It also has a right to host your speech or not as it sees fit.

&gt; 3-I never claimed internet companies are 'a law established by congress'. Did you perhaps misspeak there?

You do. The only ""freedom of speech"" granted to you is that spelled out as:

&gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

That's it. Otherwise, a corporation or individual can tell you to shut up and stop talking.

If I post a BLM sign on your lawn, you have a right to remove it.

If you post swastikas on Twitter, Twitter has a right to remove them.",2,[],[],['Donald Trump']

58992,2022-12-19 22:18:47,The Jan. 6 report will draw blood even if Trump faces no charges,,2022-12-19 22:20:38,AmericanPolitics,t3_zq5fow,"For those who have trouble with the *Post's* paywall, here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

It was the biggest surprise of the midterms: Bucking widespread skepticism, the House committee examining President Donald Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection made the cause of democracy matter to voters. Its revelations surely encouraged the defeat of numerous MAGA election-deniers, helping protect our political system against future subversion.

Now, with the panel holding its last meeting Monday in advance of the release of its final report, it appears prepared to attempt another, similar feat: making a public case that Trump committed crimes. Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) announced that the committee will recommend that Trump face several criminal charges, including insurrection.

Will this influence the Justice Department’s ultimate decision on whether to charge Trump? Probably not. And many will argue that this renders the move unnecessary or purely theatrical.

But that’s the wrong way to look at the committee’s work.

This move communicates to the public that the committee — which has examined the insurrection more deeply than anyone — believes the Justice Department should investigate whether Trump committed specific crimes. When people deride hearings as “political theater,” that’s automatically understood as a “showboating waste of time.” But successful hearings, even theatrical ones, are also acts of communication with the people. And in this case, that’s especially important.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) illustrated why in a CNN interview on Sunday. He was asked about reports that the committee will vote on whether to refer three charges: insurrection, obstruction of Congress’s electoral count and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government.

“I think that the evidence is there that Donald Trump committed criminal offenses,” Schiff said. On the charge of insurrection, Schiff added: “If you look at Donald Trump’s acts, and you match them up against the statute, it’s a pretty good match.”

Federal prosecutors are investigating Trump’s Jan. 6-related conduct in some fashion. Because their activities are properly secret, the public cannot know what’s being investigated in real time. But the committee can frame the public’s understanding of what ought to be happening, ultimately equipping the people to evaluate the department’s handling of the whole affair.

At bottom, Schiff is saying that Trump’s conduct should be measured against the insurrection statute. If the committee refers that charge, it will alert the public in a new way, formally declaring that the Justice Department should determine whether Trump gave “aid or comfort” to rioters carrying out a “rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States.” Conviction would also disqualify Trump from holding future office.

“Insurrection” would be challenging to prove, but hardly impossible. As law professor Albert Alschuler explained at Just Security, it would entail showing that Trump gave comfort to the rioters by actively refusing numerous entreaties — from Republicans and even his own advisers — to call on them to stand down while the violence raged.

It would also rely on highlighting Trump’s 2:24 p.m. tweet alerting the rioters to his vice president’s failure to subvert his loss. This essentially directed the mob to target Mike Pence, to the point where he and his security detail feared for their lives. The question would be whether that constituted lending aid or comfort to an insurrection.

Now that the committee has confirmed it will recommend the charge of insurrection, it will alert the public to the idea that Trump didn’t merely exercise what he thought were his legal options and inadvertently stray into corrupt conduct. Instead, Trump actively plotted to subvert our political order, and weaponized the mob to complete the coup after his premeditated procedural corruption failed.

Such an indication, paired with a detailed explanation of why the committee is making it, has inherent value. It primes people so they aren’t all that shocked if the department does take the extraordinary step of bringing charges against an ex-president who is running again.

“It’s speaking directly to the public,” Josh Chafetz, a Georgetown legal scholar who has written about the communicative role that Congress plays, told me. “It’s saying, ‘DOJ should bring these charges. And don’t be surprised if and when it does, because we, too, think they’re warranted.’”

And if the Justice Department ultimately declines to bring any charges recommended by the committee, Chafetz adds, department officials “are going to have more explaining to do than they otherwise would have.”

A recommendation of the insurrection charge will do one other thing. It will place the committee on record behind the proposition that Trump’s conduct might have been so criminally heinous that it disqualifies him from ever holding office again.

The vast majority of Republican lawmakers might not want to make this declaration. But the committee’s Democrats — and its two Republicans — clearly do.",2,[],[],['Donald Trump']

We might title OP's post: 

""Cheney could not have cared less how Trump behaved until the threat of Trump became *personal* to her.  

IOW, once her well-being was threatened, once his mob threatened *her* freedoms and safety, she sat up and took notice.

It's no different than the flip-flopping of Republicans who ""suddenly"" have empathy for the LGBTQ+ crowd because they ""suddenly discover"" a loved one is a member of that group.

It's a very low bar and demonstrates what passes for Republican ""integrity"" today.

NO Republican who supported him is able to erase his or her record:  

&gt;It's a con job, and the chief con artist running the whole game is Liz Cheney. She was right there at Trump's side for 3.9 years as he loaded up the Supreme Court with right-wing lunatics and ripped children from the arms of migrant mothers at the border and then proceeded to lose them in a miasma of botched red tape and incompetence. She was all-in for that crime against humanity. She was all-in for the tax cut for millionaires and billionaires like her father who used his political connections to make millions as chairman and CEO of Halliburton and then turned around and loaded up Halliburton's coffers by being the chief architect behind the war in Iraq. 
&gt;
&gt;She was all-in for Trump's absurd wall on the border, another boondoggle for Republican contractors that has done precisely nothing — zero, nada, zip — to stop migrants from crossing the border who are seeking to flee oppressive regimes in Central and South America. She is to this very day all-in on every attack on women's rights Trump enabled with his Supreme Court appointments. including the disastrous decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. She was all-in on Trump's loon-laden appointments to his Cabinet, all-in on his assaults on the environment and the regulatory powers of the EPA and other important agencies. She is still all-in on the complete legacy of Donald Trump, with the sole exception of his attempted coup after he lost the election of 2020.

In other words, she only NOW has a *duty* to ""do right, be right?""  

&gt; When asked if that includes campaigning for Democrats, Cheney said, “Yes.”
&gt;
&gt;But, Cheney would not go as far as saying that she wants Democrats to keep control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections.

*So, ...thanks for your help, but pick a side, Liz.  You want all the nefarious dumpster-fire policies and programs which DEFINE the GOP, you just oppose Trump...?*  

Don't be fooled.  Her *more experienced* background demands her party be rid of the *public* embarrassment that DJT is, to oust only ***his*** *quiet-parts-out-loud* habits which have infected and imploded the GOP.  She wants a return to GOP *quiet business as usual*, NOT *democracy*.  She is *doing her part* FOR the GOP, not *against* it.  

Watch and deal with her exactly as you would watch and deal with a [pit viper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_viper) that has wandered onto your porch.

You're correct - she upholds her own hypocrisy for votes:

&gt; I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in 15 states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law) and was very disappointed to hear her say ‘I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage’…. Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 — she didn’t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us. To have her now say she doesn’t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.
&gt;
&gt;To political commentators, Liz Cheney’s statement smacks of arrant opportunism.
&gt;

The Republican platform on hatred demands the hatred or coming out in favor of a loved one.  This is no less a flip-flop of another type; she's one thing in private and another in public.  I would put this sort of disloyalty to one's family a rung beneath a public flip-flop.  She cannot be trusted; she'll support anything to win, until it's her own life on the line.
