wow.   ...  it's not that this fraud had an effect on the primary outcome, it's that if these instances were found then there are likely others and the collection of signatures to get on the ballot is a major hurdle placed on third party and anti-establishment candidates.  They have to collect those signatures and those signatures are scrutinized carefully so that those candidates can be kept off the ballot.  The ballot access hurdle is very costly and prevents them from using those funds for advertising to build their campaign.  ... so if major ""two party"" candidates are able to get away with just forging a bunch of signatures to get on the ballot then it's a very big deal.

&gt;Number two: Indiana?s voter ID law, passed in 2008 and the model for the nine states that have adopted similar laws since the 2010 election, did nothing to prevent the alleged signature fraud, nor did it stop Indiana?s Republican Secretary of State, Charlie White, from committing felony voter fraud in the 2010 election. (White was sentenced to a year of home detention on felony fraud convictions.)

This fraud has absolutely nothing to do with the primary election where the voter ID law would apply.  It was about the collection of signatures to get on the ballot.  There are existing laws against forging signatures for ballot access, and that's why this fraud was discovered.

-------
This title is very misleading, as it completely mis-frames the CBO's analysis.  They estimate that a net total of $31 billion dollars more income would go to low-wage workers.  About 16.5 million people would see their wages rise, and somewhere between 0 - 1 million people would lose their jobs.  The *net effect* of this would be about 900,000 fewer people in poverty.

In other words, this is not a contest between 900K people on one hand vs. 500,000 on the other, like the title misleads you into thinking.  It's between *16.5 million* who gain, and somewhere between *none* and *1 million* who lose, with a **net effect** of 900,000 fewer people in poverty.

Presented honestly, it's an obvious win for the country.

Now, I'm very puzzled by the CBO even projecting the possibility of such a large number of job losses.  Sure, they admit a lot of uncertainty on that part (and only that part) of their analysis, indicating that maybe no jobs at all will be lost.  But unless I missed something, they give only one paragraph of this multipage report to the fact that shifting so much income to lower wage workers would greatly increase consumer spending, increasing demand for goods and services, and balancing out the higher cost of hiring.  Also, as far as I can tell, they mostly ignore this for the rest of the analysis.

Based on their figures, it looks like about $20 billion in additional annual spending would be prompted by an increase of the minimum wage to $10.10.  What's the effect of that much high-impact fiscal stimulus on employment?  They never really say.  Why was this left out of the discussion?

Anyway, leave aside that tangent and take their projections at face value.  But look at it honestly, not in the  way the title frames it.  Yes, it's obviously a net win.",3,['Barack Obama'],[],[],"President Barack Obama's plans to raise the minimum wage could lift 900,000 people above the poverty line but may cost half a million jobs, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said.

Sure, the CBO is non-partisan.  Regardless, it is very difficult to make such an assured forecast.

Personally, I think this policy will be a wash.  It's political theater.  In a generation this discussion will take place again, the same arguments will be made, and systemic problems with pricing labor will persist; and in twenty years, if esoteric trade agreements like TPP are implemented and $10.10 wage earners compete with $.28 a day workers in say...

Keith Olbermann's version is at the bottom 
 The Myth of the ""liberal"" media

 Let's do a ""what if"" so I can make a point. I think it's a good one. 
 I think it's so good, I'd like to hear from anyone who disagrees.

 What if a show like Dateline did a ""hatchet job"" on George W. Bush? 
 It wouldn't have to really be a hatchet job, but any honest appraisal of that idiot's 
 qualifications would prove he's a non-thinking rich man's boy - and that's all. 
 But what would happen if Dateline did an unflattering portrait of Bush?

 I'll tell you what would happen:

 The vulgar Pigboy would spend at least three hours saying it wasn't true 
 and he'd offer hours of rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Bill O'Reilly would spend at least an hour on his show saying 
 it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Sean Hannity would walk all over Alan Colmes for an hour that night, 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Eva Von Zahn  would spend at least an hour that night saying it wasn't true 
 and she'd offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 The Beltway Boys would spend at least an hour that night saying it 
 wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Brit Hume and Tony Snow would spend at least an hour on Sunday 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Juan Williams and Mara Liason would spend their entire allotted time 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 John McLaughlin would spend at least an hour on his syndicated show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Chris the Screamer would spend at least an hour on his show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 G. Gordon Liddy would spend at least three hours on his radio show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Michael Medved would spend at least an hour on his radio show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Sam and Cokie would spend at least an hour on This Whore

 George (Judas Maximus) Steffi and George (dumb as a chimp) Will 
 would spend their entire allotted time swearing that it wasn't true.

 Bob Scheiffer would spend at least an hour on Face the Whore 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Tim the Catholic would spend at least an hour on Meet the Whore 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 John Hockenberry would spend at least an hour on his show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Ollie North would spend at least an hour on his radio show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Robert Novak would spend at least an hour on his cable TV show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Paul Weyrich would spend at least an hour on his cable TV show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Still with me? We're close to the end... 

 BSNBC's Brian Williams would spend at least an hour on his show 
 saying it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Wolf the Whore would spend at least an hour on his show saying 
  it wasn't true and offer rebuttal as to why Dateline was lying.

 Bill Schneider and Candy Crowley would do an hour special on CCN  
  (Clinton Cock Network) saying it wasn't true, and offering rebuttal. 

 John Stossel would have a special on ABC:  Is lying OK for liberals?

 Then Howie Kurtz would spend 30 minutes on Reliable Sources asking  
  if the media wasn't being too hard on a developmently-disabled child. 

 Barbara Olson would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Ann Coulter would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Laura Ingraham would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Peggy Noonan would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  Andrew Sullivan would write a book condemning Dateline.  
  William Safire would write a book condemning Dateline. 

 OK, we're going to call the above ""Exhibit A."" 

 Now, everyone on that list has done at least a dozen hit pieces on Clinton. 

 My question is,   Where is ""Exhibit B?""

 When those 38 people attack Clinton and his cock, who does the rebuttal?

 Even you ditto-sheep have to admit that nobody on that list  
  has EVER defended a fabricated lie against the president. 

 There is no ""Exhibit B,"" because there are so few liberal voices on television.  
  The closest you can get is Eleanor on McLaughlin or Geraldo, but there is barely  
  a liberal whisper on television, even though there are DOZENS of right-wing,  
  Smirk-apologist shows whose livelyhood is lying about liberals. 

 I don't think you ditto-heads can offer an answer.

The article isn't about Republican leaders wanting to pick the nominee themselves but how they want to change the Republican primary process where voters pick the nominee. 

But the article itself is bad. It focuses on **how** the GOP wants to change the process with no mention of **why**. *How* they want to change it is to reduce the exposure of Republican candidates to unscripted moments. You know, those moments where they may face tough questions and have to think on their feet. But *why* the GOP wants to reduce those opportunities for voters to get insight into the candidates is the interesting part of the story. The reason is that the Republican Party has become so extreme that it's national candidates have to walk a tightrope. Their message has to be carefully managed so that it doesn't offend either their radical base on one hand or the general public on the other. 

For the 2012 campaign the GOP forgot how wrongheaded much of Republican rhetoric sounds to the rest of the country and just looked at how the extended Democratic primary battle in 2008 helped Barack Obama. That year the Democratic primary contest was long, and actually thoughtful on occasion, and gave plenty of exposure to Obama while John McCain sewed up the nomination quickly and had to wait in the wings with relatively little national attention. With no serious Democratic challenge to be mounted against a sitting president in 2012 the GOP lengthened their primary and scheduled lots of debates figuring they could recreate the same situation in their favor. Oh how they were wrong. 

It's not that there aren't crazy, off the deep end, leftwingers. They certainly exist. But they don't have any political power. The only use the Democratic Party has for them (other than hoping they hate and fear the GOP enough to hold their noses and vote Democratic) is to hold them up to say, ""These are the crazy liberals. We are sensible moderates!"" Democratic rhetoric doesn't alienate general election voters. On the contrary. That's exactly who it is aimed at. So a long and relatively open primary debate was good for eventual Democratic nominee Barack Obama. 

Not so for poor Mitt Romney. To appease the rightwing extremists he was forced to downplay his single significant political success: Romneycare. That made him look like a fool when he had to attack the same basic plan President Obama had gotten enacted on a national level. Romney had to toe the radical conservative line and say he wouldn't make a deal on the budget that included even massive spending cuts if it meant raising taxes slightly. Those sorts of things damaged him in the eyes of general election voters and they also failed to unite the GOP faithful behind him. They continued to see him as a moderate and continued to put up one unviable candidate after another to challenge his frontrunner status. The primary went on and on with one nutjob after another becoming the favorite to unseat Romney as the favorite. It was a joke but Republican leaders weren't laughing.

So they have vowed to make changes this time around. This time they aren't going to forget how toxic many standard Republican views are to mainstream America. They aren't going to let clowns like Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain grab the spotlight and tarnish their nominee. They aren't going to allow debate questions that force candidates to openly take extreme positions to get ahead in the primary but hurt them in the general election. In short, they are going to remember who they are: the batshit crazy party. They will do their best to hide that from general election voters.
