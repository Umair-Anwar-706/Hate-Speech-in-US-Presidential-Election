I mean the man just had one of his casinos file for bankruptcy....What the hell kind of extreme mismanagement causes a casino to go bankrupt?  \\n\\nStories abound about how he misrepresents his wealth.\\n\\nThe man is shady period, and that's not going to go over well with the majority of Americans.\\n\\nI just can not see that man being a legitimate candidate.  \\n\\nThe speculation seems to be that a presidential run was floated simply to increase the ratings of his latest TV venture with other people's money.\\n\\nTo the point though; sure I believe the story.  I'm sure he has a poor voting record.   \n",
