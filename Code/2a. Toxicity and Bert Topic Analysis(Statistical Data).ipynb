I think the reason it worked with Barack Obama is that Barack Obama was younger. He was thirstier, more ambitious. He wasn't set in his ways, he wasn't a curmudgeon. He was open to working with other people and sharing the spotlight. I think Joe Biden's thinking is that, for that role, the most qualified person is most likely a woman. Probably a younger woman, very possibly a black woman.

          "If you have problems with the paywall, here is the text of the op-ed:\n\n---\n\nPoliticians often flatter their audiences, but at a rally in Bemidji, Minn., last month, President Donald Trump found an unusual thing to praise about the nearly all-white crowd: its genetics. “You have good genes,” he insisted. “A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory. … You have good genes in Minnesota.”\n\nIn case it was not clear from the sea of white faces that he was making a point about race, Donald Trump later said the quiet part out loud. “Every family in Minnesota needs to know about Sleepy Joe Biden’s extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet,” he declared.\n\nDonald Trump’s ugly endorsement of race-based eugenics got national attention, but in a presidency filled with outrages, our focus quickly moved to the next. Besides, this wasn’t the first time we’d heard about these views. A “Frontline”documentary reported in 2016 that Donald Trump believed the “racehorse theory” of human development that he referred to in Minnesota — that superior men and women will have superior children. That same year, the Huffington Post released a video collecting Donald Trump’s statements on human genetics, including his declarations that “I’m a gene believer” and “I’m proud to have that German blood.”\n\nOn eugenics, as in so many areas, the scariest thing about Donald Trump’s views is not the fact that he holds them, but that there is no shortage of Americans who share them. The United States has a long, dark history with eugenics. Starting in 1907, a majority of states passed laws authorizing the sterilization of people deemed to have undesirable genes, for reasons as varied as “feeblemindedness” and alcoholism. The Supreme Court upheld these laws by an 8-1 vote, in the infamous 1927 case Buck vs. Bell, and as many as 70,000 Americans were sterilized for eugenic reasons in the 20th century.\n\nAmerica’s passion for eugenics waned after World War II, when Nazism discredited the idea of dividing people based on the quality of their genes. But in recent years, public support for eugenics has made a comeback. Steve King, a Republican congressman from Iowa, tweeted in 2017, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” The comment struck many as a claim that American children were genetically superior, though King later insisted he was concerned with “the culture, not the blood” of foreign babies.\n\nEugenics has also had a resurgence in England, where the movement was first launched in the 1880s by Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin. In February, Andrew Sabisky, an advisor to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, resigned after it was revealed that he had reportedly written blog posts suggesting that there are genetic differences in intelligence among races, and that compulsory contraception could be used to prevent the rise of a “permanent underclass.” Richard Dawkins, one of Britain’s most prominent scientists, added fuel to the fire by tweeting that although eugenics could be criticized on moral or ideological grounds, “of course” it would “work in practice.” Eugenics “works for cows, horses, pigs, dogs &amp; roses,” he said. “Why on earth wouldn’t it work for humans?”\n\nThere is reason to believe the eugenics movement will continue to grow. America’s first embrace of it came at a time when immigration levels were high, and it was closely tied to fears that genetically “inferior” foreigners were hurting the nation’s gene pool. Eugenicists persuaded Congress to pass the Immigration Act of 1924, which sharply reduced the number of Italian, Jewish and Asian people allowed in.\n\nToday, the percentage of Americans who were born outside the United States is the highest it has been since 1910, and fear of immigrants is again an animating force in politics. As our nation continues to become more diverse, the sort of xenophobia that fueled Donald Trump‘s and King’s comments is likely to produce more talk of “better” genes and babies.\n\nIt is critically important to push back against these toxic ideas. One way to do this is by ensuring that people who promote eugenics are denounced and kept out of positions of power. It is encouraging that Sabisky was forced out and that King was defeated for reelection in his Republican primary in June. Hopefully, Donald Trump will be the next to go.\n\nEducation, including an honest reckoning with our own tragic eugenics history, is another form of resistance. It is starting to happen: Stanford University just announced that it is removing the name of its first president, David Starr Jordan, a leading eugenicist, from campus buildings, and that it will actively work to better explain his legacy. We need more of this kind of self-scrutiny from universities like Harvard, Yale and many others that promoted eugenics and pseudo race science, as well as institutions like the American Museum of Natural History, which in 1921 hosted the Second International Eugenics Congress, at which eugenicists advocated for eliminating the “unfit.”\n\nDonald Trump’s appalling remarks in Minnesota show how serious the situation is now. Seventy-five years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, a United States president not only spoke about “good genes” in racialized terms — he believed that his observations would help him to win in the relatively liberal state of Minnesota. It is crucial that everyone who understands the horrors of eugenics works to defeat these views — before they become any more popular.",

          "So no rebuttal I see lol. Thanks for clearing up that you agree with my comment after all. I'm glad we're on the same page, bud.",
          "Why bother?  If I point out how ridiculous and insulting your claim is that I don't hold conversations, you'll just insult me and not provide any sort of evidence to back up your claim.  You didn't even bother address my comment at all about the ridiculousness of the claim in the article, which ironically makes you look like a bot. I think that's because you cannot bring yourself to make an actual counter argument and prefer to harass and attempt ad hominin attacks instead of actually commenting on the article."

          "I'd like to see Donald Trump's tax returns.",
          "The Republican National Committe (RNC) pays alot of his legal bills via donors. They have practically emptied their coffers doing so.\n\nAs Trumps legal bills mount? He's not using his money from his bank.\n\nHe is using money sent to his PAC (donations to help him get elected) along with money from the RNC.\n\n&gt;*Donald Trump’s leadership PAC, Save America, has blitzed supporters in recent days with fundraising solicitations that focus on next month’s high-stakes contest for control of Congress. “It is IMPERATIVE that we win BIG in November,” blared an email last week. The group has contributed about $8.4 million so far directly to Republican campaigns and committees, while devoting $7 million to Donald Trump’s lawyers and another $2 million to the nonprofits, which employ former members of his administration, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Legal fees are expected to climb, Donald Trump advisers say, as he employs a growing retinue of lawyers to fend off federal, state and county-level investigations.*\n\nJust how many PACs does one person need? \n\n&gt;*But since leaving Washington, DC, in January 2021, he's lined the coffers of his several post-president political action committees — Save America PAC, Make America Great Again PAC, and the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee among them — with tens of millions of dollars, sometimes sending prospective donors two or three email and text message fundraising solicitations each day.*\n\nAnd he can't find good attorneys.\n\nWhen asked why they were paying his legal bills that way?\n\n&gt;*In response to questions about the use of donor money to cover the former president’s legal bills, Donald Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich accused Democrats of “weaponizing taxpayer dollars with fake investigations and meritless cases in an attempt to intimidate and silence Republicans.”*\n\nHe thinks PAC money is for his personal use. Like a piggy bank. He does not use his personal funds. He uses the dollars and cents hardworking people send in for his re-election.\n\nHe constantly sends requests to his donors, but his donors are running out of money. Just like all of us? They live paycheck to paycheck and the constant begging from Donald Trump is emptying their coffers too.\n\n&gt;*Those donors, said one GOP fundraiser, are being “told they’re pitching in for a fight against Democrats” but are instead “helping Donald Trump fight off his legal problems.” Some Donald Trump small-dollar donors have reached out to the former president’s office to say they’d like to give more but cannot afford it after receiving so many requests.*\n\nDonald Trump has kept his money close to him. He has a hard time spending it on the needs of others.\n\n&gt;*The series of six- to seven-figure ad placements from super PAC Make America Great Again Inc. on Wednesday in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada is a last-minute boost from Donald Trump's team ahead of the November election. It follows months of criticism from Donald Trump skeptics within the GOP that the former president is not spending enough to support 2022 GOP candidates, despite his massive fundraising power.*\n\nIMO? \n\nThe unhinged grifter known as one term twice impeached former President Donald Trump has __major mental and physical health issues__ that preclude him from functioning within the parameters of reality.\n\n__16 times Donald Trump's political action committees promised worthless rewards for a donation__ [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/Donald Trump-Donald Trump-political-committee-pac-donations-contributions-president-2024-2022-9).\n\n__How Donald Trump’s legal expenses consumed GOP donor money__ [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/11/Donald Trump-legal-fees-donor-funds-rnc).\n\n__New Donald Trump-backed super PAC pours $8.6 million in ad spending into key races__ [here](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Donald Trump-backed-super-pac-injects-million-ad-spending/story?id=91762119).\n\nEdit - fixed voice to text issues.",

But hey, feel free to browse through my post history to try and prove that I'm  CTR shill. Be sure to pay particularly close attention to my posts when Bernie Sanders was still running.\nAll the evidence you need is right there for the taking.",

          "It's unequivocally true that Washington runs on money, and this administration has done little to nothing to change that fact, but I do have to point out that bundlers aren't donors.  They're people who go out and get donations from others.  There is still a substantial [individual limit on direct donations](http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/limits.php).  So instead of donors, the headline should say \"fundraisers\" -- which is a big difference.",
          "Nope. None of the ones you listed were Super PACs (IEOCs). They are PACs. BIIIIIIIG difference in donation limits. Huge difference, actually. Just like Joe Biden, you spread lies without knowing anything about what you are lying about.",

          "&gt;Even as former president Donald Trump was trying to overturn the results of the presidential election in December last year, he still managed to rake in $15,846 from the US exchequer during a Christmas holiday at his Palm Beach resort.

Even saying that by itself isn't necessarily unethical, it just seems to be a strong indicator of a worldview that habitualizes immoral behavior. You have to consider too that \"self interest\" is extremely nonspecific. When acting in your own self interest entails literally doing what you have to do to survive and feed your family, then you probably have several more morally permissible routes to achieving that than someone who's acting in their own self interest by trying to tack a few extra million onto an already sizable fortune. If you can do that without trampling people who are struggling then more power to you, if not then what you're doing is wrong.\n\nAt the end of the day I bet we probably just have different views on what our moral obligations to other people are, but hopefully that gives you a good snapshot of my perspective.",

And just the president is not enough.\n\n\nActually? We know the tax release is voluntary. But __it is a tradition.__\n\n&gt;From temperament to professional background, Former President Donald Trump didn't exactly fit the mold when it came to occupants of the Oval Office. One other area where he defied presidential norms: refusing to release his federal tax returns to the public. That veil was finally lifted when The New York Times got hold of two decades’ worth of Donald Trump’s filings, showing paltry $750 tax bills in 2016, the year he was elected, and in 2017, when he assumed office, in part due to massive business losses and controversial write-offs. Given Donald Trump’s unwillingness to release this information, it’s ironic that the whole tradition of sharing tax filings with the public started with another president who got into hot water over his generous deductions: Richard Nixon.\n\nDon't forget?\n\nFrom the beginning __he said he could not release his taxes because he was being audited.__\n\n\nIn actuality? The audit had nothing to do with him releasing his taxes.  Former President Donald Trump just didn't *want them to be released* because he thought it would __make him look bad.__\n\nHe fought the courts tooth and nail. All the way to the Supreme Court. __Where he lost.__\n\nIt __had nothing to do with the fact that he was being audited.__ \n\n\nAs a matter of fact? \n\nThe IRS consistently mentioned that the fact that he was being *audited* had nothing to do with his ability to release his taxes to the public.\n\n&gt;Donald Trump broke decades of precedent as both a presidential candidate and occupant of the White House by refusing to voluntarily release his income tax returns. He had said his returns were under audit by the IRS as a justification for not disclosing the returns. But there is no prohibition on taxpayers releasing their returns to the public even when those returns are being audited.\n\nI guess if __I were a billionaire, and I only paid $750 in taxes__ (which he did more than once by the way)? Then of *course* I wouldn't want that information released to the public. In actuality, I pay a lot more than that. \n\nBut he must've figured that *eventually* people would find out?\n\nWhat did he think would happen? __I for one find it very upsetting.__\n\nPresidential candidates and other government employees are __legally required__ to complete \"Personal Financial Disclosure” documents with the Federal Election Commission (FEC)\n\n&gt;Today, the President and Vice President released their public financial disclosure reports. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 requires high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on OGE Form 278. The public filing system serves to prevent financial conflicts of interest by providing for a systematic review of the finances of government officials. Those finances are set forth in annual disclosures, which are reviewed and certified by the independent Office of Government Ethics. Neither the President nor the Vice President have any conflicts of interest.\n\nAnd his submittals were, lets say, *heavily influenced* by alternative facts.\n\nLike? Fantasy land.\n\n__It's all coming out now.__\n\nI had heard that former President Donald Trump would tear documents into tiny pieces and then *chew on them.*\n\nI was __unaware of the fact that he'd actually flush documents__ down the toilet and clog up the pipes at the White House. \n\nMore than once.\n\n*Imagine that?*\n\nSo many documents, so many secrets, so many disgusting things we __will never know about.__ \n\nBut that's okay.

          "This is an illogical argument. You think a Jewish person consciously thought, “I’m not voting for bernie sanders because he is Jewish”? did it every occur to you that they maybe instead thought “I don’t think bernies radical ideas would fit in with a mainstream audience and captivate enough independents and moderate democrats/republicans to get him elected over Donald Trump.”\n\nI’m not saying I’m not a massive supporter of bernies policies/goals, just saying it’s much more likely voters had the second thought it mind when voting for Joe Biden over bernie in the primaries. It’s just really illogical to attribute his loss in the primary to “bernie sanders didn’t get enough liberal support because most of that voter base is anti-Semitic and wouldn’t elect a Jewish man”",
          "Alright. I’m not gonna bother explaining why what you just said is completely wrong, and I’m not gonna waste my time listing everything that was wrong in the primaries. You’re subbed to neoliberal, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden subs, as well as that Bernie hating sub. There’s no way I’m wasting my time on someone like you.",
          "I am a man, but that doesn't matter.  Men can be put off by mysogeny too.  We've come a long way. It has all the same problems.  It allows for the benefit of the doubt.  These quotes the announcer is using mean nothing without some citation.  These could just be paraphrased to make him look bad.  It is far too easy to dismiss and the DNC is literally just throwing away perfectly good ammunition with these ads.  They'd be great with some very simple additions, but the fact that these are already out on the internet shows some serious lack of judgement in the Florida DNC.",

          "&gt; He lied about Joe Biden’s record on social security.\n\nJoe Biden has never advocated for cuts to SS?\n\n&gt; Had his surrogates call him corrupt while claiming he ran a clean campaign. \n\nI mean, Joe Biden didn't vote in favor of MBNA when his son was working there? His son and brother haven't consistently received high paying jobs or just straight money from industries Joe Biden has been voting in favor of? Joe Biden is corrupt as a mofo and Sanders himself should have called him out.\n\n&gt;Lied about Warren, sent his campaigners out to trash her, \n\nSource? You have proof that Sanders told his supporters to go out and tweet snake emojis, or are you making baseless accusations about Sanders, like Warren did?\n\n&gt;lied about Buttigieg and his donors, the list goes on. \n\nPete didn't have billionaire donors?\n\nThose weren't very good examples. \n\nJoe Biden lied about his history on SS. Joe Biden lied about Bernie's donors. Saying Bernie had \"9 super PACs.\" Warren lied about Bernie saying a \"woman couldn't be President.\" You made this way too easy by using the most common neolib talking points. LOL\n\nNeolib go grrrrrrrr",
          "As someone I know said, \"imagine a presidential choice so clear that Bernie Sanders and George W. Bush HW George W. Bush were voting for the same candidate\"",
          "I agree that someone needs to hit back. I just wish it wasn't Warren. When the Dems take back the Senate she is poised to become a genuine national leader, perhaps with as much power as Bernie or Hillary, whoever wins. Let some firebrand, low profile new senator go after Donald Trump. It would be nice if the so-called liberal media would also start acting like, oh I don't know, journalists!\n\nDon't you see what is happening here? Donald Trump told a major news outlet that on matters of foreign policy he consults himself \"because he has a good brain and says a lot of things.\" This is not taken out of context. Donald Trump doesn't want to be president as much as he wants to fuck everything up (and Cruz isn't that far behind in this line of reasoning). He mocks his own supporters when he says inane shit like this and his supporters love him for it. Why should Warren act like this? How is meeting stupid with stupid \"hitting back?\"\n\nIt isn't even the 'loser' thing that really bothers me. It's the fact that Warren is wasting her precious time even acknowledging this fool. The Kochs are unlikely to be spending that $100 million they pledged on Donald Trump but will instead dump that cash into state races which has been a very successful strategy for the GOP. Even if Hillary or Bernie wins the WH it will be much ado about nothing if the GOP retains a Senate majority. They are perfectly happy obstructing for another 8 years, I can promise you that.",
          "I believe Sanders is a socialist and I've heard a 'Marxist', even.  Either way, should he become President, theoretically, Congress and the Supreme Court would keep him from going too far (subjective too far - how much is too far), but neither the Supreme Court or Congress have earned much trust with me.",
          "That's some history revisionism. They were too busy scaremongering about a Sanders nomination to talk about Sanders' immense win in Nevada for more than a day.",
          "&gt; then you neoliberals should have voted for sanders in the primary.\n\nThat's literally what I did. And I canvassed for him. And I donated to his campaign. \n\nWhy do you assume that, simply because someone is going to vote for Joe Biden in the general, that they didn't support Bernie in the primary? That's literally the point of a primary to pick which candidate left-leaning voters will coalesce around in the general, because First-Past-the-Post really only works with 2 candidates.\n\nYou don't \"take your ball and go home\" when the candidate you preferred gets fewer votes and doesn't become one of the two viable nominees.",
          "One reason is because it was never a mainstream political story. Bernie Sanders himself was never the cult of personality stereotype some people believed or that his more extreme supporters (those who claim voter fraud) embodied.  \n\nIf Sanders said \"Hillary stole the election\" that would be a pants on fire for sure. But Bernie is just a progressive, not a conspiratorial moron.  ",
          "I usually agree with Krugman but in this case it seems like a pretty clear cut case of fearmongering. \n\nNobody gives a fuck about Bloomberg. *Nobody*. Let him run as an independent all day long..he's just throwing money away. \n\nEven the people who *like* Bloomberg don't think he'd make a good president so I'm wondering who all these mystery democrats are who are going to get behind him. Bloomberg was a joke as mayor (almost as big of a joke as fucking what's his name, who was mayor during 9/11). \n\nSo my response: \n\nDear Paul Krugman:\n\nHow have you not anticipated that nobody gives a fuck about one of the most embarrassing politicians from our time? Bernie's supporters aren't going to defect, that's for sure. \n\nAnd I do believe Hillary's supporters are smart enough to support Bernie if he gets the nomination. \n\n*(Although, I'm not so sure Bernie's supporters are smart enough to do the same for Hillary if she gets the nomination…and I'm being 100% honest.)\n\nBernie supporters are the wildcard here…not Hillary supporters. They are strict democrats for the most part who support her for the decades she has taken the grillings from the right.\n\nAnd to be frank, why *wouldn't* a true democrat support Hillary? The right absolutely hates her, they've gone after her endlessly (with no real results)…to me, that's a pretty clear cut reason to support her if she gets the nomination. \n\nLeave it to the idiots on the left to start echoing all the bullshit about Benghazi and email servers…honestly, I've noticed many Bernie supporters are now using this as some kind of battle cry as the race gets closer ant that tells you absolutely everything you need to know about those people. \n\n*Anyone* who tries to use Benghazi as mud in a mudslinging effort against Hillary is on the right or as dumb as the majority on the right. End of debate.",
          "Oh, Jesus Christ. \n\nThe worst part of this election has been watching democrats turn slowl in the hateful, fearful republicans they hated so much just one year ago. \n\nReciting Fox News talking points. Buying into the bullshit. This is the perfect example of trademark fearmongering that republicans sell to their base on a daily basis, now being served up fresh by fellow democrats. \n\nGross. \n\nIt's also bullshit that every time I make a rational post on here I have to make a disclaimer that I support Bernie and I will be voting for him in my state's primary election. But I do. Because otherwise I get attacked in comments (and I still will..people will accuse me of being a Hillary shill and lying about supporting Bernie and they'll dig up an old comment where I was critical of Bernie to prove it.)\n\nSorry…I just don't buy into the bullshit and rhetoric. It was sad whenever that's all the republicans had to cling to and it's sad whenever democrats are falling into the same approach. \n\nI still maintain that many of Bernie's supporters on Facebook and reddit are new to the political process and don't understand it very well. I'm not going to pigeonhole and say that the majority fall into that category; I'm just saying that there are way too many who don't understand basics about delegates and how nominees are chosen, superdelegates, the general election, etc. \n\nBernie is electable, it's just that this past month was make or break for him in attracting a larger piece of other demographics and it doesn't look as if he was able to do it. But we will know a lot more on Tuesday night and that's whenever it will all come into clearer view. \n\nSaid it many times, will say it again: You cannot get someone elected with anger, hashtags and memes. It just doesn't work that way. Hillary ran in 2008. She's a lifelong democrat, she is married to the most popular president of your and my lifetime. She's been a senator and Secretary of State.

She's very well liked if only because she's married to Bill Clinton (again, arguably the most successful/popular president for any democrat alive today).\n\nAnyone suggesting she is disliked by the democrats is insane and ignoring basic facts and simply reciting Fox News Benghazi/OMG email server bullshit witch hunt. \n\nIt was bullshit before Bernie started running and it's bullshit now. It's just that now *democrats* are the ones reciting it instead of republicans. \n\nI will say this: I don't mind her and I will be more than happy to vote for her in a general election if she gets the nomination. And the more I see the bernie or bust hashtag, the more I warm up to her. \n\nAgain, one year ago it seemed republicans were the only demographic willing to slit their own throats out of ignorant pride; these days, democrats can be added to that list of unfortunate people as well.

Among other influences, like the revolving door of regulatory capture. \n\nWe're taxed, but not represented, because the only thing that incentivises accountability to the people, is compromised by wealthy elite, like those that participate in influence peddling, such as Donald Trump and Hillary Bill Clinton. The result of this has led to 40 years of growing income inequality, which systemically is intertwined with every other issue. While wealth and power has been centralizing, the government is getting more authoritarian. From military spending, to wars, to growing/privatizing prisons, to spy agencies eroding civil liberties, to militarized police. Both of these aspects, centralizing power and growing authoritarianism, are having severe effects on the quality of life both here and abroad.\n\nAn accountable government supersedes every other issue. No policy will change in your favor without one. Not healthcare, not environment, not education, not military, not trade, until politicians are more incentivised to work for the people, then for corporate donors. That means 1 person 1 vote. That means electoral accountability.\n\nThe question at this point is what to do about it, because that's what the Sanders campaign was for, so if he's done. It's over unless someone has some other ideas.\n\nBernie Sanders has to run third party, or pull a hat trick at the convention.

Then she lost likely due to not campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan and being a corrupt and uninspiring politician but guess who’s blamed for her losing, us and Bernie.

          "1) Way to ignore 95% of my comment.\n2) I don't think you know what 'success' means when primarying a sitting President. As a rule, the goal is not to unseat the incumbent, but to encourage him to adopt policies closer to your position, similar to 3rd party candidates in the general. The most successful examples are probably Robert Kennedy, whose primary challenge of Lyndon B. Johnson was predicted to beat him until his assassination, but did result in Johnson's defeat, and Theodore Roosevelt, whose primary run against Taft directly lead to Taft doubling down on harsh anti-trust laws, with Roosevelt's 3rd party run causing Taft's defeat in the general. General, primaries against sitting Presidents are tokens foisted to threaten the President in the general if he refuses to adopt certain positions. This was used effectively in the lead up to the '92 and '96 elections to pressure George W. Bush Sr. further left, and Bill Clinton further right leading into the elections, and it is probable that Bernie could threaten a primary of Joe Biden to split the party in 2024 unless Joe Biden adopts more progressive policies. However, again, that is not the plan. The plan to primary Joe Biden's chosen *replacement* most likely Kamala Harris, who already lost one primary to both Sanders and Warren.",

And for anyone who wants those policies to be in any way progressive, aiding and abetting a Donald Trump presidency is absolutely indefensible from any rational standpoint. When you listen to them try to defend it, their motives are either incredibly selfish or incredibly stupid. The selfish ones are along the lines of, \"Hillary didn't earn *my* vote (because I'm just sooooo fucking important and being personally pandered to is more important than policies that affect people).\" And the stupid ones are along the lines of, \"Maybe after 4 years of Donald Trump, everyone will see the light and magically become ultra-progressive and we will have decades of presidents just like Bernie.\"\n\nAs for \"real\" supporters, Bernie and every other major political figure who has ever contributed to real progress on the issues he cares about have all come out swinging against Donald Trump and said they'll vote for Bill Clinton. Everyone who actually cares about these policies -- and I would say that actually caring about the views he represents is a fair requirement for a \"real\" Bernie supporter -- is united in opposition to Donald Trump. The holdout Bernie-or-busters are actually very much like Donald Trump's supporters, in that they're probably motivated more by blind rage at the establishment and cultish ingroup/outgroup thinking than by any rational concerns about policy.

          "“ExCuSe mE, I’m going to go read economic theory of a 19th century Eastern European.”\n\nWhich European? Why would you even throw that at the end of your argument? Also support for Bernie shouldn’t be conflated with a want for revolution, people just want change. For someone who is apparently “in the left” you use the same terminology as someone from r/TheDonald. The guy you are arguing with is completely right as well. It’s very hard to ignore Joe Biden’s allegations and political history along with the fact that he was never a rock solid candidate from the start. He had iffy support and you know it, he has a horrible track record for sexual misconduct and literal assault, and he can’t make a single speech without fluttering around like a mental patient. Joe Biden quite possible has dementia or something else hindering his ability to carry an interview and he is also avoiding them altogether. The Coronavirus has allowed him to sit on the sidelines as quietly as possible while the media starts to look into Tara Reade seriously. With all the distraction he is still losing his lead. Young feminists and progressives hate him, anti-war voters hate him, he is losing demographics by the minute. Most women won’t be too keen to vote for a rapist and may vote third party. This has nothing to do with a revolution. This is a weak candidate who has a horrible policy history who was propped up and could easily lose this election for us without it even really getting started. You guys have the audacity to blame progressives for this situation, if they wanted our vote they should’ve maybe given us some voice in the past 20 years. This is a product of misguided political regimes not the blunder of young progressives. You spit in the face of everyone who believes in anything when you get all pissed off that we don’t want to vote for a racist rapist who’s policy history is literally the same as many staunch Republicans. Of course so many people don’t want to vote for him he’s a regressive old dementia ridden molester who has a history of getting hands with kids and vehemently supporting the Iraq war and strict border control. Real charmer.",
          "Commented this on another post, but this still feels relevant. \n\nAs a Bernie supporter, it truly does astound me how little the voter turn-out was for the primaries. Don’t get me wrong, I know the DNC made their move the weekend before Super Tuesday against Bernie to make his chances slim, but the real fucking shame is that his base didn’t the counter the DNC by coming to vote in full force.\n\nAll of these anti-Joe Biden memes are meaningless, even if what you are accusing of him is true. Why don’t you guys actually do something productive and influence the Democratic Party to become more progressive? You know, like Bernie did? Voting for a third-party is not a viable option for people who cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump; and to act like four more years of this man in office would be just as devastating as four years of Joe Biden is just bewildering to me. Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell will continue vacating court seats and shape many significant political decisions for decades to come if they are able to stay in power.\n\nAll of you who won’t vote for Joe Biden on the premise that he’s a rapist, you’re allowing Donald Trump to get away with FAR more than what Joe Biden is being accused of. I don’t see a viable third-party option without inadvertently helping Donald Trump win the election. Remember, 100% Bernie Sanders supporter, but I’m willing to think about the well-being of others and understand that I have to make a sacrifice right now in order to defeat Donald Trump. Had his base actually turned out to vote, there wouldn’t have been any sacrifice to make. This is of our own doing and it’s cringey to see other people not take responsibility and just make shit-tier memes. Until we can come out and vote in full-force, sacrifices will have to be made and progressive policies will be stagnant. It’s up to us, not any singular politician.",

          "&gt; If the opposite of this were true, and Bernie actually did well with non-white voters, then you wouldn't hesitate to parade this around as proof that Bernie has a broad coalition and that Bernie has the support of minorities.\n\nWe did. A lot. Weren't you watching the ads? Or even listening to how often he repeated it?\n\nJoe Biden got SC, the state that he was bound to get and skipped over multiple ones to campaign in and then the DNC got the others to drop out and the narrative was set. Joe Biden is the unity candidate, he had a bad early run but his nomination is a foregone conclusion—why else would the other moderates clear out immediately? They know he's going to win. \n\nAnd then, Bernie's strong polling with all of these communities started to tank because what's the point? I knew several people from my local masjid who were excited to vote for Bernie and then go \"there's no point\" as early as our voting date on Super Tuesday.\n\nHe had the minority support, it's just that all of us underestimated the DNC's ability to craft a narrative.",

And we've established that Bernie repeatedly failed to overcome this obstacle. The logical conclusion is that Bernie would've probably failed against this obstacle *again* in the general election.",
          "How does this refute my point? Bernie polled higher than Joe Biden in a head to head poll with him around the time he won Nevada because he seemed to be doing better than Joe Biden in early states and the electability argument was shifting toward Bernie, but of course SC happened and the media non stop said this means Joe Biden is more electable, even so he won a state Dems would almost never win in a general.",

This primary was basically a war against medicare for all and ending the war on drugs.

(In the rural, majority Republican area where I live, based on yard signs Donald Trump is clearly the #1 candidate.)\n\nWhat I find is that Donald Trump supporters all disagree with him on one or more of Donald Trump's positions. A *huge* part of his appeal is that he \"tells it like it is\" and is not the typical Demopublican/Republocratic lawyer/politician who speaks in highly polished, mindless rhetorical platitudes.\n\nThere is also a *massive* frustration with Washington politics in general, and Donald Trump supporters express a view that he'll shake things up. YMMV.\n\nIMO Sanders could have tapped into the same veins of discontent and frustration, but instead of coming off as an actual socialist, Sanders has moved to the center and is portraying himself as just another neo-liberal Democrat.",

          "I understand it sucks that Bernie lost the primary. I understand that it’s sucks that Joe Biden is being accused of raping someone. But we HAVE to think about how Donald Trump is so dangerous to this country. We have to think of all the progressive ideas that we want to have in this country in the future. If Donald Trump wins because so many people voted third party when they could’ve voted for Joe Biden, RBG dies in the next 4 years, and the Supreme Court rules that gun control CANNOT be passed in the future because there is a conservative lean to the court, then what?? Think of all the Muslims in this country that can face discrimination as Donald Trump keeps adding more Muslim countries to the travel ban, making it impossible for their relatives to visit them. There are so many other examples of people suffering under Trumps presidency as well, we know them! We are all upset that Bernie lost but we HAVE to consolidate around Joe Biden or he will NOT win in November. I agree that his record is atrocious, but it is NOT as bad as Donald Trump, you have to agree with me on that. Also, unfortunately we live in a country with a two party system, and we don’t have ranked choice voting nationwide, so people are right when they say a vote for a third party is worthless, and when that vote could’ve been for Joe Biden, it is a vote for Donald Trump, guys cmon we KNOW this! I do not enjoy supporting someone accused of rape for president, nobody does, but please please think of the people that are SUFFERING because of trumps presidency. And consider helping them with your vote. Joe Biden needs it, and the people Donald Trump is hurting with his xenophobic and fear mongering words need it.",
          "Bernie lost because he thought everyone would stay in and he’d only need 30% of the vote. He then allowed his campaign to harass and alienate pretty much everyone who would align with him. He’s the only person to blame for his failure. The man spent time after Nevada taking victory laps on twitter rather than reaching out and gaining endorsements and support. Not to mention that he hired some of the worst possible choices to be his campaign staff. \n\nDid you really expect the Democrats to not coalesce around one candidate to stop the man who isn’t even a democrat and spends far too much time talking about how terrible they are from getting their nomination?",
          "The Entire reasoning behind Joe Biden should be supported over bernie was the myth of his electability and appeal to monstrous right wingers like George W. Bush. It's why they invited horrible neocons like John Kasich and Colin Powell to speak at the democratic national convention. Just like in the video I posted he ran to republicans looking for Brownie points and still in the end those people he's now saying are \"too far left\" saved his ass, while those conservatives he bent over backwards to swing went 94% for Donald Trump. This is exactly the problem in this election cycle.",
          "Probably hard to understand as an outsider.  It would make more sense if you lived here and followed the DNC's misinformation campaign and the media's complicity in that campaign of misinformation and spin.",
          "Let’s be honest. Every argument you make in favor of Joe Biden winning the primary is the exact same arguments you made during 2016. And Hillary lost really fucking bad. Hillary said Joe Biden’s campaign is really similar to hers. Which basically means he’s going to lose.",
          "It's obvious by now Fox News and Donald Trump were betting on running against Bernie. \"Radical left, killing God\". Thank baby Jesus bernie lost.",
          "I mean Sanders supporters were pretty determined that voter fraud occurred against him as well - I remember at least one such claim hitting the front page of reddit highly upvoted.  Where is the pants on fire for that?  Of course, that also wasn't the super specific out of context granularity of problem that polifact likes to boil things down to.  But I don't think it is as partisan as you make it out to be.\n\nOne of the links I found: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4mic9i/sanders_campaign_alleges_fraud_in_puerto_rico/",

          "Wonder if this message was approved by the DNC?",
          "I'm not focusing specifically on South Carolina.  Like I said, you can look at any state with a significant non-white population.  Sanders didn't just lose them, he got crushed.  It's why he lost.  In a system that allocates delegates proportionally based on vote count, every vote counts.\n\nYou say that it was known that Joe Biden was likely going to win those southern states.  Okay, so why didn't Bernie spend four years trying to win them instead?  Those states are the key to the nomination and that's what beat him in 2016.  They have Barack Obama the nomination too.  You blame everyone but Bernie even though Bernie is the one who failed to put together a winning strategy.  That's not James Clyburn or Bill Clinton's fault, that's Bernie's fault.",
          "Where is bernie mentioned? A sub that stops criticizing a terrible nominee because of outside influence is a bad thing. I’m done arguing. Bye",
          "He was mathematically eliminated from getting 1237 delegates but there was still a chance that by remaining in, he would also prevent Donald Trump from getting 1237 and achieving a contested convention.",
          "No one is “screeching” or “crying”, just pointing out the obvious DNC shenanigans in the primary.\n\nOf course Bernie’s campaign wasn’t perfect, but it was a hell of a lot better than Joe Biden’s. Bernie raked in $40+ million in small dollar individual donations in February 2020 alone. The policies that Bernie put at the core of his campaign (M4A, aggressive climate policy, getting big money out of politics) remain immensely popular among the American public - including moderates. So I’m not worried about winning elections based on the merits of policy. Had the primaries played out without DNC interference, Bernie would have won easily.\n\nUnless we fix the primary process we will continue to get neoliberal right-wing Dems shoved down our throat for the foreseeable future, and we will never get the chance to vote for the candidates who challenge the status quo in the general election. Both parties benefit from maintaining the status quo, and if you can’t see that then idk what to tell you.",
          "The griping is just that in the most diverse democratic candidate field we have had, in a time where everything is literally falling apart, democrats pick fucking Joe Biden.\n\nThat's the frustration, and it's not just about Bernie."

Barr’s tireless efforts to help then-President Donald Trump escape accountability for his role in the Russia scandal.\n\nUnder the new attorney general, Merrick Garland, the department is attempting to keep secret a key memo from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) concerning the Russia investigation. It would shed light on the failure to prosecute the former president for obstruction of justice.\n\nThe department’s reticence is understandable in some ways. But it’s a mistake. In this case, transparency is a necessity.\n\nThis complicated story goes back to Barr’s effort to shape public understanding of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report on Russia’s efforts to help get Donald Trump elected and Donald Trump’s efforts to scuttle an investigation into them.\n\nMueller’s report laid out evidence strongly suggesting the conclusion that Donald Trump had indeed committed extensive criminal obstruction of justice. But Mueller also concluded that some previous OLC analysis, which held that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, precluded him from explicitly saying what his evidence showed in terms of potential criminality.\n\nThe memo in question concerns Barr’s rationale for not charging Donald Trump. In justifying this decision, Barr cited an OLC memo he claimed he’d relied upon in making it.\n\nIn a case that began when Donald Trump was still president, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed suit to access the memo. Donald Trump’s Justice Department wanted to keep it secret.\n\nJoe Biden’s Justice Department has come to the same conclusion, arguing that since it relates to internal deliberations it shouldn’t be made public.\n\nBut in a ruling earlier this month, federal judge Amy Berman Jackson excoriated the department. Having read the memo, Jackson suggested it indicates that Barr and the department badly misled the public in claiming it as the rationale for not charging Donald Trump. She ordered the memo released.\n\nHere’s what makes this so controversial. The department had claimed Barr relied on the OLC memo in his decision-making, as though it were some kind of neutral arbiter whose judgment he sought. But Jackson revealed that, in fact, the OLC memo was written in cooperation with Barr while he was making his own decision about how to handle Mueller’s report.\n\nIn essence, Barr and the OLC were, in Jackson’s words, working “hand in hand to craft the advice” — cooperating to form a strategy that would be most beneficial to Donald Trump.\n\nGiven all this, more transparency is called for. Noah Bookbinder, the president of CREW, notes that the memo could reveal in new detail just how far Barr went in perverting the law to protect Donald Trump.\n\n“We may well see a sham legal analysis that was set up to publicly defend the president, not to answer a real legal question,” Bookbinder told us.\n\nWhat’s at stake is whether we’ll ever fully understand the extent of the cover-up executed on behalf of Donald Trump by people who were supposed to be operating our legal machinery on behalf of the public and the national interest.\n\nThe Mueller report “laid out devastating facts showing that the president of the United States likely repeatedly violated the criminal law of this country,” Bookbinder said. “Barr was able to confuse things enough that most people kind of missed that, and nothing ever came of it.”\n\nBookbinder added that if the memo is released, the public might want to revisit the question of whether Donald Trump should be held accountable now that he’s no longer president.\n\nIf the memo shows a “bogus analysis to facilitate a cover-up,” Bookbinder said, more people might say, “There’s no reason for that case to be closed.”\n\nIt’s possible, of course, that this is a key reason for the reluctance to release the memo: If it does demonstrate that Donald Trump was protected in a highly corrupt way, it might increase pressure to revisit the case.\n\nTo be sure, there are other good reasons to keep internal deliberations about prosecutions private. But to say this is a unique case would be an understatement.\n\n“The Justice Department always wants to protect its own lawyers, and they want to look out for confidentiality of documents,” Bookbinder told us. “But I’m genuinely disappointed that they didn’t seem to grasp that this is an unusual situation.\"\n\nIn this case, the Justice Department was “manipulated for the political and personal benefit of the president of the United States,” Bookbinder said, adding that the department now has “an opportunity to come clean.”\n\nIf it doesn’t come clean, the department will be facilitating the act of keeping the public in the dark about its own previous misconduct on a corrupt American president’s behalf. But if it does, that would enable the department to put a very dark moment behind it and restore public credibility.\n\nAfter all, the misconduct that we saw over and over — not just Donald Trump’s, but Barr’s as well — constituted a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and to the rule of law. That being the case, we need to know everything we can about how it happened.\n\nEven if most such OLC memos should be kept private, this isn’t one of them. We need to know it all.",

The GOP is going to try and make this all about politics (policies.)",

          "ITT - the usual naysayers/paid Russian trolls trying to pretend that this is anything like past times for Donald Trump. \n\nUnlike the armchair prosecutors here, Garland understands exactly what the stakes are and the unprecedented nature of this case against  an ex-president. He knew the level of scrutiny and the potential abuse the GOP would throw at him when he pulled the trigger.\n\nWhat these negative Nancies are conveniently leaving out is the deafening silence from the top Republicans.  They realized early on just what was happening  and how bad it was likely to get and have kept their usual partisan mouths shut. \n\nThis is nothing like what had gone.",
          "Wrong clown, Donald Trump wanted DOJ to go after his political enemies with fake charges, whereas we had 2 impeachments and the Jan6th committee just scratching the surface of the felonies he has committed. People have been executed for less than 1/100000000000 of the evidence we have on him.",
          "I am all for fostering unity. Thats why I think prosecuting former presidents is a bad idea. Do you think the Donald Trump supporters are going to forget and forgive if we do prosecute him? It will just foster more resentment. There is already a very big \"us and them\" attitude with the words, civil war, being tossed around. None of us should want that.",
          "Does that mean we can have the unredacted Muller report?",
          "I agree. There have been a dozen smoking guns already. What about the dismantling of the post office? What about allowing Russia to put bounties on the heads of US soldiers? What about the Russian attack on our elections?\n\nThere is just so much corruption, it's unreal. Donald Trump is a criminal through and through.",
          "&gt;His arrest comes six months after the incident at the Capitol that disrupted the certification of current President Joe Biden’s electoral victory. According to the news outlet WGN9 , Mr Kulas will be maintaining a residence at his parents house, which is estimated to be $4.5 million, as a part of his release agreement. To verify the owner of the account, “the FBI has learned that the registration of an email address was registered by an individual who provided his name as ‘Christian Kulas’.",

          "I think we've been here before when people thought ignoring the likes of Gingrich and Fox News would allow them to flame out and disappear into obscurity.\n\nSocial media or no, Donald Trump knows how to work a crowd. Their loyalty is already assured and they're not going to forget him as long as he can still find a venue to sell tickets. Democrats pretending that he's no longer relevant won't make him go away.\n\nA Congressional hearing with testimony from administration insiders will provide the opportunity to gather information that the DOJ can use, and bring political pressure to bear so that Garland won't ignore it. Garland is dedicated to restoring the independence of the DOJ from the executive branch, but the DOJ still answers to Congress. If a Congressional hearing produces actionable testimony, then we might actually see federal charges issued. That would be a best-case scenario.",
          "How is he not in jail? Really getting sick of our parallel justice systems",
          "Eh. Until I see all the other crooks behind bars, I have little faith anyone will ever see Donald Trump behind them.",
          "Yeah, I have been using that phrase for years, hoping someday it catches on, it really describes very accurately exactly who they are: organized criminals masquerading as decent people. . .",
          "Solitary is torture. Donald Trump deserves prison, but not solitary.",
          "No it wouldn't be the same. No evidence was ever given he was colluding or conspiring with Russia. There is plenty of evidence he violated the emollients clause. Furthermore, that fact alone makes it more politically powerful. Republican voters hate grift too but you'll have to prove it to them, which would be easy if leaders on the other side weren't also guilty despite being less obvious.\n\nThe Mueller report proved a couple people that weren't Donald Trump lied, nothing beyond that. They failed to make a case against Donald Trump or Russian collusion.\n\nThe Republicans are the opposition party, in these times their voters expect them to fight every step of the way, part of that is they know Democrats won't and will bend. \n\nYour argument is don't fight because we will lose. That's how Donald Trump won.",

I don't think it's racist. But I do disagree. As somebody pointed out to me recently, Joe Biden's relationship with Barack Obama was different from most POTUS / VP relationships. They had regular meetings, they very much made decisions together. Barack Obama regularly bounced ideas off of Joe Biden's experience.\\n\\nI think Joe Biden is trying to replicate that relationship. I think the reason it worked with Barack Obama is that Barack Obama was younger. He was thirstier, more ambitious. He wasn't set in his ways, he wasn't a curmudgeon. He was open to working with other people and sharing the spotlight. I think Joe Biden's thinking is that, for that role, the most qualified person is most likely a woman. Probably a younger woman, very possibly a black woman. Having a more informal relationship with a young black female politician will be more beneficial to him than an informal relationship with an older white guy like him.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?

They always get promoted quickly to the top spots in the GOP, even named to the supreme Court despite poor qualifications.\\n\\nI remember a black taxi driver telling me was voting Republican because democrats want to take away his guns.   Think about that awhile.  When Barack Obama brought about a national mood of racial unity violent crime went down 15%.   Under Donald Trump, 100% of mass murders and terrorists attacks were perped by his own fans plus hundreds of racist cop murders of unarmed blacks. and yet this guy wants the party that dehumanizes him to be in charge just so he can own assault rifles, which I guess he may need if the KKK types ever take over.\",\"Except the old black man in the picture would be 80% more likely to vote for Joe Biden.\",\"Was this before or after he said that [black people who don't vote for him aren't *really* black people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhcgmwj3NAc)\",\"Except she never said that Joe Biden was a racist.

So it's a big waste of our time, done to make some pointless administrators feel good and cover the university's ass legally. We're scientists. Every hour spent on their bullshit is an hour spent not doing science.\\n\\nOther universities are starting to require that students take a class in the pseudo-intellectual \\\"identity studies.\\\" And the identity studies departments themselves are wasting an incredible amount of time and university money, while giving nothing back to society. They're actively harming the very demographics they purport to be helping, by luring them into wasting four years of their lives and tens of thousands of tuition dollars pursuing a worthless piece of paper instead of a valuable one. It may even be less than worthless, because instead of teaching them critical thinking or life coping skills they're teaching people to run from ideas they don't like, to hide in \\\"safe spaces,\\\" to \\\"de-platform\\\" opposing viewpoints instead of confronting them, to cry over unintentional \\\"microaggressions\\\" instead of growing thick skin, to value ideology over reason, and to value themselves and other people according to the number of underprivileged demographic checkboxes they can check instead of their character and accomplishments.

The racehorse theory. \\u2026 You have good genes in Minnesota.\\u201d\\n\\nIn case it was not clear from the sea of white faces that he was making a point about race, Donald Trump later said the quiet part out loud. \\u201cEvery family in Minnesota needs to know about Sleepy Joe Biden\\u2019s extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet,\\u201d he declared.\\n\\nDonald Trump\\u2019s ugly endorsement of race-based eugenics got national attention, but in a presidency filled with outrages, our focus quickly moved to the next. Besides, this wasn\\u2019t the first time we\\u2019d heard about these views. A \\u201cFrontline\\u201ddocumentary reported in 2016 that Donald Trump believed the \\u201cracehorse theory\\u201d of human development that he referred to in Minnesota \\u2014 that superior men and women will have superior children. That same year, the Huffington Post released a video collecting Donald Trump\\u2019s statements on human genetics, including his declarations that \\u201cI\\u2019m a gene believer\\u201d and \\u201cI\\u2019m proud to have that German blood.\\u201d\\n\\nOn eugenics, as in so many areas, the scariest thing about Donald Trump\\u2019s views is not the fact that he holds them, but that there is no shortage of Americans who share them. The United States has a long, dark history with eugenics. Starting in 1907, a majority of states passed laws authorizing the sterilization of people deemed to have undesirable genes, for reasons as varied as \\u201cfeeblemindedness\\u201d and alcoholism. The Supreme Court upheld these laws by an 8-1 vote, in the infamous 1927 case Buck vs. Bell, and as many as 70,000 Americans were sterilized for eugenic reasons in the 20th century.\\n\\nAmerica\\u2019s passion for eugenics waned after World War II, when Nazism discredited the idea of dividing people based on the quality of their genes. But in recent years, public support for eugenics has made a comeback. Steve King, a Republican congressman from Iowa, tweeted in 2017, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\\u2019s babies.\\u201d The comment struck many as a claim that American children were genetically superior, though King later insisted he was concerned with \\u201cthe culture, not the blood\\u201d of foreign babies.\\n\\nEugenics has also had a resurgence in England, where the movement was first launched in the 1880s by Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin. In February, Andrew Sabisky, an advisor to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, resigned after it was revealed that he had reportedly written blog posts suggesting that there are genetic differences in intelligence among races, and that compulsory contraception could be used to prevent the rise of a \\u201cpermanent underclass.\\u201d Richard Dawkins, one of Britain\\u2019s most prominent scientists, added fuel to the fire by tweeting that although eugenics could be criticized on moral or ideological grounds, \\u201cof course\\u201d it would \\u201cwork in practice.\\u201d Eugenics \\u201cworks for cows, horses, pigs, dogs &amp; roses,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhy on earth wouldn\\u2019t it work for humans?\\u201d\\n\\nThere is reason to believe the eugenics movement will continue to grow. America\\u2019s first embrace of it came at a time when immigration levels were high, and it was closely tied to fears that genetically \\u201cinferior\\u201d foreigners were hurting the nation\\u2019s gene pool. Eugenicists persuaded Congress to pass the Immigration Act of 1924, which sharply reduced the number of Italian, Jewish and Asian people allowed in.\\n\\nToday, the percentage of Americans who were born outside the United States is the highest it has been since 1910, and fear of immigrants is again an animating force in politics. As our nation continues to become more diverse, the sort of xenophobia that fueled Donald Trump\\u2018s and King\\u2019s comments is likely to produce more talk of \\u201cbetter\\u201d genes and babies.\\n\\nIt is critically important to push back against these toxic ideas. One way to do this is by ensuring that people who promote eugenics are denounced and kept out of positions of power. It is encouraging that Sabisky was forced out and that King was defeated for reelection in his Republican primary in June. Hopefully, Donald Trump will be the next to go.\\n\\nEducation, including an honest reckoning with our own tragic eugenics history, is another form of resistance. It is starting to happen: Stanford University just announced that it is removing the name of its first president, David Starr Jordan, a leading eugenicist, from campus buildings, and that it will actively work to better explain his legacy. We need more of this kind of self-scrutiny from universities like Harvard, Yale and many others that promoted eugenics and pseudo race science, as well as institutions like the American Museum of Natural History, which in 1921 hosted the Second International Eugenics Congress, at which eugenicists advocated for eliminating the \\u201cunfit.\\u201d\\n\\nDonald Trump\\u2019s appalling remarks in Minnesota show how serious the situation is now. Seventy-five years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, a United States president not only spoke about \\u201cgood genes\\u201d in racialized terms \\u2014 he believed that his observations would help him to win in the relatively liberal state of Minnesota. It is crucial that everyone who understands the horrors of eugenics works to defeat these views \\u2014 before they become any more popular.\",\"Condemn it. It was horribly racist.\",\"Yes.

It's often well-meaning but terribly impolite.\\n\\n What you need to save your breath for are Donald Trump's rank-and-file, the young, angry, and displaced wannabe fascists who stockpile guns and fantasize about murdering minorities in self-defense, as well as the soulless capitalists that profit off the strife while plundering the earth. I'm more upset about them than Joe Biden calling Barack Obama \\\"articulate\\\" in 2000-fucking-7.\",\"'Donald Trump is a racist'\\n\\nTell a lie, tell it often, make it a whopper and the ignorant among the citizenry will believe that they actually believe it.\",\"Enough of this nonsense. \\n\\nHe was right about the shackles comment. The GOP would love to have black propel in shackles. And the junkie thing was to a reporter who asked him if he took a mental fitness test to show how dumb the question was. \\n\\nJoe Biden has done more for African Americans than Donald Trump ever will.\",\"Well a lot of universities are favouring enrolling minorities over whites, Google it, it's widespread. There's plenty of other incidents where whites are treated like second class citizens look at all the Antifa and BLM also, it's all anti white.\",\"Considering one of the neoliberal Kweens, Hillary Bill Clinton, had slaves, they most likely agree with that argument as well.

It's literally ther first thing he does to please his white supremacist base: blame the minorities, punish the minorities, justify hating the minorities,  then incite violence towards them.  He's probably got a written out handbook somewhere. He's very proud of it.  He titled it \\\"I defeated the pandemic,  wuhan (as in you can) too!\\\" Lmao fucking moron.\",\"Him saying that Romney was going to put black people back in chains has ruined him forever for me.\",\"You've kind of proven my point about nativist conspiracy mongering.\\n\\nNo, Indian people aren't black... but many people from the Caribbean ARE.

Are Nigerians black? Kenyans? Congolese? Black South Africans? Ethiopians? Haitians? Afro-Brazilians? Afro-Trinidadians?\\n\\nAlso lets be honest here, if you didn't know who Kamala Harris was and saw her on the street would you assume she was black? I don't particularly like Kamala Harris, but it has nothing to do with her skin color or ethnic background, and discriminating on those standards is... well racist.\",\"Ugh.

I got into it with someone yesterday about how saying most people who act like Karen's are white.\\nI was accused of being racist\",\"I'm not saying Joe Biden isn't doing well on race issues, I just don't believe race issues are what led black people away from Bernie. Least of all Joe Biden Rogan's endorsement of Bernie. I was just extrapolating a conclusion about Joe Biden based on your logic of why Bernie did poorly with Black voters.\\n\\nI think there is a lot more nuance in why Bernie did poorly with Black voters, beyond race issues.

See, it wasn't that hard to provide some information for others that you so willing want an opinion from until that opinion contradicts your own, now is it?\",\"Sorry if it came off that way, I'm fine. It's just that whenever this gets brought up, people always seem to throw their credentials out there like they hold some serious weight. I've handled classified material myself. I know the rules.

It is really, really common.\",\"One of the problems I have in life is that I constantly underestimate the stupidity of others.\",\"I hate to see such negativity, but I guess some realism doesn't really hurt.\",\"You completely misinterpreted my statement.\",\"The stupidity that you have is such a turn off.\",\"yeah... you seem to be talking to an imaginary caricature rather than me...\",\"Like Mother always says, \\\"You reap what you sow.\\\".\",\"And you have nothing to say.\",\"probably your lack of education?\",\"can\\u2019t stand people with this way of thinking. so inutile.\",\"In order to have a conversation, you have to be willing to listen\",\"That was lefteryet...sorry...you just defended him and no the troll would be you.\",\"You're right.

If I point out how ridiculous and insulting your claim is that I don't hold conversations, you'll just insult me and not provide any sort of evidence to back up your claim.  You didn't even bother address my comment at all about the ridiculousness of the claim in the article, which ironically makes you look like a bot.

I think we have a cultural tendency in the US to conflate efficiency with morality. In this case, Donald Trump didn't cause the market crash that he took advantage of, and so the only action  I had a gripe with was his expressed excitement about a situation that was ruining a lot of lives because it was going to benefit him. Even saying that by itself isn't necessarily unethical, it just seems to be a strong indicator of a worldview that habitualizes immoral behavior. You have to consider too that \\\"self interest\\\" is extremely nonspecific. When acting in your own self interest entails literally doing what you have to do to survive and feed your family, then you probably have several more morally permissible routes to achieving that than someone who's acting in their own self interest by trying to tack a few extra million onto an already sizable fortune. If you can do that without trampling people who are struggling then more power to you, if not then what you're doing is wrong.\\n\\nAt the end of the day I bet we probably just have different views on what our moral obligations to other people are, but hopefully that gives you a good snapshot of my perspective.\",\"Donald Trump has a long history of being close to and donating to the Clintons.   \",\"People donated over 50 million dollars to her to have it be used for ads that praised Donald Trump and to lose by more than 20 points, oof.

But __it is a tradition.__\\n\\n&gt;From temperament to professional background, Former President Donald Trump didn't exactly fit the mold when it came to occupants of the Oval Office. One other area where he defied presidential norms: refusing to release his federal tax returns to the public. That veil was finally lifted when\\u00a0The New York Times\\u00a0got hold of two decades\\u2019 worth of Donald Trump\\u2019s filings, showing paltry $750 tax bills in 2016, the year he was elected, and in 2017, when he assumed office, in part due to massive business losses and controversial write-offs. Given Donald Trump\\u2019s unwillingness to release this information, it\\u2019s ironic that the whole tradition of sharing tax filings with the public started with another president who got into hot water over his generous deductions: Richard Nixon.\\n\\nDon't forget?\\n\\nFrom the beginning __he said he could not release his taxes because he was being audited.__\\n\\n\\nIn actuality? The audit had nothing to do with him releasing his taxes.  Former President Donald Trump just didn't *want them to be released* because he thought it would __make him look bad.__\\n\\nHe fought the courts tooth and nail. All the way to the Supreme Court. __Where he lost.__\\n\\nIt __had nothing to do with the fact that he was being audited.__ \\n\\n\\nAs a matter of fact? \\n\\nThe IRS consistently mentioned that the fact that he was being *audited* had nothing to do with his ability to release his taxes to the public.\\n\\n&gt;Donald Trump broke decades of precedent as both a presidential candidate and occupant of the White House by refusing\\u00a0to voluntarily release his income tax returns. He had said his returns were under audit by the IRS as a justification for not disclosing the returns. But there is no prohibition on taxpayers releasing their returns to the public even when those returns are being audited.\\n\\nI guess if __I were a billionaire, and I only paid $750 in taxes__ (which he did more than once by the way)? Then of *course* I wouldn't want that information released to the public.

I disagree with alot of political points but I wont hold his wealth against him. \",\"I tried doing what Donald Trump does and just owning failed businesses but that doesn't work :(\\n\\nGuess I should've been born rich\",\"His entire company is based on a currently dead industry due to COVID, and he doesn\\u2019t get any donations because he\\u2019s not politically active. If this wasn\\u2019t obvious then I don\\u2019t know what is.\",\"He didn't want to, but had to keep up with the Koch brothers.  David Axelrod even said it wasn't Pbama's idea to raise all that money, so I'd say it's Axelrod's fault\",\"Not at all surprising. He's already broken the law, I think (tax fraud), for money. This would be no different.\\n\\nI mean he has taken advantage of BANKRUPTCY for profit... What kind of low-life piece of junk does that? Only Donald Trump -_-\",\"Don\\u2019t forget veterans, vendors, lawyers, students, political supporters...\",\"I thought he was rich and could afford things?  Hmmmmmmm\",\"Yeah...

I remember all those manila folders.\\n\\nI'm sure [Donald Trump totally isn't still running his businesses](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2019/03/18/president-Donald Trump-trumps-promises-didnt-end-business-entanglements/3030377002/).\\n\\nI'm totally sure Donald Trump didn't make around [$20 million in China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/Donald Trump-taxes-china.html), and that there is no way there are any bribes in that money.\\n\\nDonald Trump has more manila envelopes to prove it.\\n\\n&gt; In 2017, the company reported an unusually large spike in revenue \\u2014 some $17.5 million, more than the previous five years\\u2019 combined. It was accompanied by a $15.1 million withdrawal by Mr. Donald Trump from the company\\u2019s capital account.\",\"And this charity actually paid him that. Is this a responsible way to spend donation money?\",\"Not really just because you run as a democratic candidate you can't expect to get airtime you have to give something to get if. Donald Trump I am sure bribed with people behind the scenes and Sanders didn't, and Bill Clinton mainly got coverage for her emails in the beginning. Also if you are railing against the party don't expect to get good treatment from them same goes for Donald Trump. \",\"It might show that he really spends little time in the USA and might travel to tax shelters a lot to conduct international business to hide the money. \",\"So that\\u2019s how much he extorted while in office?\",\"&gt;Don't be ridiculous in thinking any good politician has turned down money from American citizens.\\n\\nWait corporations are people?\",\"Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy): Yeah.

Donald Trump won't disclose his financials, so its a \\\"mystery\\\".\\n\\nJust kidding.  It's illegal.  We have a \\\"foreign emoluments\\\" clause in the Constitution because our Founding Fathers foresaw a need to prevent foreign governments from trying to bribe US politicians.  Dirtbags like Donald Trump have always been around...we just typically don't elect them and pretend they are suddenly trustworthy.\",\"I highly doubt that Trumpbaby contributed anything.

And all the neocons who now support him?\",\"I'm saying you obviously don't care about taxes or you wouldn't support a famous tax cheat and person who steals from **veteran's and children's charities** as well. \\n\\nIt's not whataboutism, it's a simple observation of fact that you don't actually care about America or Americans, you only care about providing fellatio for Donald Trump and hating on his enemies.\",\"If you *don't* reimburse people then they are seen as being paid by the campaign.\\n\\nThey can't just cover the expenses themselves either as that is a violation of the campaign laws as it is seen as a gift. \",\"&gt; Not sure what you mean by that\\n\\nYou would be a sucker for contract that screwed you over.\\n\\nHillary's was \\\"I'll vote for you!\\\"\\n\\nDonald Trump's is a threat of a law suit against you for the rest of your life should you say anything bad about him.\",\"My argument about the revelations of Donald Trump cheating in business and with taxes is that his supporters actually think this is a good thing.

It is far too easy to dismiss and the DNC is literally just throwing away perfectly good ammunition with these ads.  They'd be great with some very simple additions, but the fact that these are already out on the internet shows some serious lack of judgement in the Florida DNC.\",\"No way in our lifetimes is someone unseating a sitting president in primaries\",\"&gt; He lied about Joe Biden\\u2019s record on social security.\\n\\nJoe Biden has never advocated for cuts to SS?\\n\\n&gt; Had his surrogates call him corrupt while claiming he ran a clean campaign. \\n\\nI mean, Joe Biden didn't vote in favor of MBNA when his son was working there? His son and brother haven't consistently received high paying jobs or just straight money from industries Joe Biden has been voting in favor of? Joe Biden is corrupt as a mofo and Sanders himself should have called him out.\\n\\n&gt;Lied about Warren, sent his campaigners out to trash her, \\n\\nSource?

Bush were voting for the same candidate\\\"\",\"I agree that someone needs to hit back. I just wish it wasn't Warren. When the Dems take back the Senate she is poised to become a genuine national leader, perhaps with as much power as Bernie or Hillary, whoever wins. Let some firebrand, low profile new senator go after Donald Trump. It would be nice if the so-called liberal media would also start acting like, oh I don't know, journalists!\\n\\nDon't you see what is happening here? Donald Trump told a major news outlet that on matters of foreign policy he consults himself \\\"because he has a good brain and says a lot of things.\\\" This is not taken out of context. Donald Trump doesn't want to be president as much as he wants to fuck everything up (and Cruz isn't that far behind in this line of reasoning). He mocks his own supporters when he says inane shit like this and his supporters love him for it. Why should Warren act like this? How is meeting stupid with stupid \\\"hitting back?\\\"\\n\\nIt isn't even the 'loser' thing that really bothers me. It's the fact that Warren is wasting her precious time even acknowledging this fool. The Kochs are unlikely to be spending that $100 million they pledged on Donald Trump but will instead dump that cash into state races which has been a very successful strategy for the GOP. Even if Hillary or Bernie wins the WH it will be much ado about nothing if the GOP retains a Senate majority. They are perfectly happy obstructing for another 8 years, I can promise you that.\",\"I believe Sanders is a socialist and I've heard a 'Marxist', even.  Either way, should he become President, theoretically, Congress and the Supreme Court would keep him from going too far (subjective too far - how much is too far), but neither the Supreme Court or Congress have earned much trust with me.\",\"That's some history revisionism. They were too busy scaremongering about a Sanders nomination to talk about Sanders' immense win in Nevada for more than a day.\",\"&gt; then you neoliberals should have voted for sanders in the primary.\\n\\nThat's literally what I did. And I canvassed for him. And I donated to his campaign. \\n\\nWhy do you assume that, simply because someone is going to vote for Joe Biden in the general, that they didn't support Bernie in the primary? That's literally the point of a primary to pick which candidate left-leaning voters will coalesce around in the general, because First-Past-the-Post really only works with 2 candidates.\\n\\nYou don't \\\"take your ball and go home\\\" when the candidate you preferred gets fewer votes and doesn't become one of the two viable nominees.\",\"One reason is because it was never a mainstream political story. Bernie Sanders himself was never the cult of personality stereotype some people believed or that his more extreme supporters (those who claim voter fraud) embodied.  \\n\\nIf Sanders said \\\"Hillary stole the election\\\" that would be a pants on fire for sure. But Bernie is just a progressive, not a conspiratorial moron.  \",\"I usually agree with Krugman but in this case it seems like a pretty clear cut case of fearmongering. \\n\\nNobody gives a fuck about Bloomberg. *Nobody*. Let him run as an independent all day long..he's just throwing money away. \\n\\nEven the people who *like* Bloomberg don't think he'd make a good president so I'm wondering who all these mystery democrats are who are going to get behind him. Bloomberg was a joke as mayor (almost as big of a joke as fucking what's his name, who was mayor during 9/11). \\n\\nSo my response: \\n\\nDear Paul Krugman:\\n\\nHow have you not anticipated that nobody gives a fuck about one of the most embarrassing politicians from our time? Bernie's supporters aren't going to defect, that's for sure. \\n\\nAnd I do believe Hillary's supporters are smart enough to support Bernie if he gets the nomination. \\n\\n*(Although, I'm not so sure Bernie's supporters are smart enough to do the same for Hillary if she gets the nomination\\u2026and I'm being 100% honest.)\\n\\nBernie supporters are the wildcard here\\u2026not Hillary supporters. They are strict democrats for the most part who support her for the decades she has taken the grillings from the right.\\n\\nAnd to be frank, why *wouldn't* a true democrat support Hillary? The right absolutely hates her, they've gone after her endlessly (with no real results)\\u2026to me, that's a pretty clear cut reason to support her if she gets the nomination. \\n\\nLeave it to the idiots on the left to start echoing all the bullshit about Benghazi and email servers\\u2026honestly, I've noticed many Bernie supporters are now using this as some kind of battle cry as the race gets closer ant that tells you absolutely everything you need to know about those people. \\n\\n*Anyone* who tries to use Benghazi as mud in a mudslinging effort against Hillary is on the right or as dumb as the majority on the right. End of debate.\",\"Oh, Jesus Christ. \\n\\nThe worst part of this election has been watching democrats turn slowl in the hateful, fearful republicans they hated so much just one year ago. \\n\\nReciting Fox News talking points. Buying into the bullshit. This is the perfect example of trademark fearmongering that republicans sell to their base on a daily basis, now being served up fresh by fellow democrats. \\n\\nGross. \\n\\nIt's also bullshit that every time I make a rational post on here I have to make a disclaimer that I support Bernie and I will be voting for him in my state's primary election. But I do. Because otherwise I get attacked in comments (and I still will..people will accuse me of being a Hillary shill and lying about supporting Bernie and they'll dig up an old comment where I was critical of Bernie to prove it.)\\n\\nSorry\\u2026I just don't buy into the bullshit and rhetoric. It was sad whenever that's all the republicans had to cling to and it's sad whenever democrats are falling into the same approach. \\n\\nI still maintain that many of Bernie's supporters on Facebook and reddit are new to the political process and don't understand it very well. I'm not going to pigeonhole and say that the majority fall into that category; I'm just saying that there are way too many who don't understand basics about delegates and how nominees are chosen, superdelegates, the general election, etc. \\n\\nBernie is electable, it's just that this past month was make or break for him in attracting a larger piece of other demographics and it doesn't look as if he was able to do it. But we will know a lot more on Tuesday night and that's whenever it will all come into clearer view. \\n\\nSaid it many times, will say it again: You cannot get someone elected with anger, hashtags and memes. It just doesn't work that way. Hillary ran in 2008. She's a lifelong democrat, she is married to the most popular president of your and my lifetime. She's been a senator and Secretary of State. She's dealt with heads of states, foreign policy, etc. \\n\\nI'm pointing out that she's not the dark horse people want to paint her out to be. She's very well liked if only because she's married to Bill Clinton (again, arguably the most successful/popular president for any democrat alive today).\\n\\nAnyone suggesting she is disliked by the democrats is insane and ignoring basic facts and simply reciting Fox News Benghazi/OMG email server bullshit witch hunt. \\n\\nIt was bullshit before Bernie started running and it's bullshit now. It's just that now *democrats* are the ones reciting it instead of republicans. \\n\\nI will say this: I don't mind her and I will be more than happy to vote for her in a general election if she gets the nomination. And the more I see the bernie or bust hashtag, the more I warm up to her. \\n\\nAgain, one year ago it seemed republicans were the only demographic willing to slit their own throats out of ignorant pride; these days, democrats can be added to that list of unfortunate people as well. And that's pretty sad\\u2026for as ignorant and stubborn as they are, republicans seem more reasonable (or at least more unified) than the democrats at this point. And that says all you need to know where this upcoming election is concerned. \",\"^ How to win over Bernie supporters 101. /s\",\"I don't see it at cheating, that's completely valid. Moderates would want a moderate candidate, so to vote for one makes all the sense in the world to me.\\n\\nThe ability for the moderates to unify behind Joe Biden was far more effective than the ability for progressives to unify behind Bernie, and that handed Joe Biden the nomination. That isn't cheating, that's just how it went.\",\"&gt;Now a clue to those Hillary supporters who continually put down Bernie supporters.\\n\\nI agree that HC supporters shouldn't put down Bernie supporters, but this isn't about Bernie supporters at large, it's specifically about \\\"Bernie or bust\\\" protesters.

I subscribe to a very instinctual kind of world outlook.\",\"Why Bernie Sanders should keep fighting:\\n\\nThe republic is no longer accountable to the American people because the electoral process is littered with conflicts of interest and power centralizing mechanisms. Such as campaign finance bribery, gerrymandering, the debates being controlled by the parties, electronic voter fraud, registration disenfranchisement, centralizing profit based media, absurd ballot access laws, first past the post election format, and super delegates. Among other influences, like the revolving door of regulatory capture. \\n\\nWe're taxed, but not represented, because the only thing that incentivises accountability to the people, is compromised by wealthy elite, like those that participate in influence peddling, such as Donald Trump and Hillary Bill Clinton. The result of this has led to 40 years of growing income inequality, which systemically is intertwined with every other issue. While wealth and power has been centralizing, the government is getting more authoritarian. From military spending, to wars, to growing/privatizing prisons, to spy agencies eroding civil liberties, to militarized police. Both of these aspects, centralizing power and growing authoritarianism, are having severe effects on the quality of life both here and abroad.\\n\\nAn accountable government supersedes every other issue. No policy will change in your favor without one. Not healthcare, not environment, not education, not military, not trade, until politicians are more incentivised to work for the people, then for corporate donors. That means 1 person 1 vote. That means electoral accountability.\\n\\nThe question at this point is what to do about it, because that's what the Sanders campaign was for, so if he's done. It's over unless someone has some other ideas.\\n\\nBernie Sanders has to run third party, or pull a hat trick at the convention. Otherwise we're solidifying this fascist oligarchy ever deeper into our society. Likely past a point of no return.\",\"The DNC is not going to let Sanders have the nomination. \",\"&gt; No \\\"woke games\\\" is \\\"Joe Biden said we need unity!

Try and wrap your smooth brain around that one. We were with you while you had Sanders. Now you backstabbed Sanders, we're done with you. \\n\\nIf the progressive wing drops of the democratic party then both the progressive wing and the moderate wing lose. It is indisputable that both sides of this party need each other to function. You claim it's unity bullshit but its just a fact that if you divide 60% of the electorate into 2 then the other 40% wins because they are united.\\n\\nBy the way, Sanders was \\\"backstabbed\\\" by his own unpopularity.

The consequences of a Donald Trump presidency are far too disastrous for anyone to even think of sitting out the fight against him. To do so really is incredibly selfish and immature, and it deserves nothing better than condescension. \\n\\nThe proper way to punish the DNC and establishment for their actions is to support progressive challengers in future primaries and work harder to exert influence within the party for the progressive wing... *not* to help inflict Donald Trump upon the innocent people of this country. That doesn't just punish Hillary or the DNC. It punishes the people Bernie wants to fight for. That's why Bernie himself has spoken out against \\\"Bernie or bust\\\" in the strongest terms he possibly can, and his *real* supporters -- yes that's a valid thing in this case -- take heed.\",\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/sanders-supporters-not-vote-Bill Clinton-221642\\n\",\"I am absolutely disgusted by the Wall Street wing of the Democratic party that threatened to support Donald Trump if Elizabeth Warren was nominated.

They all intentionally ignore that the DNC worked against these candidates.  Coordinated with CNN/MSNBC to smear these candidates. Stayed silent when polling stations in minority and college town areas were closed down.  Didn't say a peep when close battleground states had exit polls off favoring Joe Biden enough for the UN to intervene.  While Bloomberg spent over $1,000,000,000.00 to directly influence a US election. Rigged audiences to boo for Sanders while he talks about child literacy.  Pulled the \\\"Gold Standard Poll\\\" a day before Super Tuesday.  And then made some phone calls to combine the corrupt moderates into Joe Biden even though one of those candidates had twice as many delegates as him.\\n\\nOh and Bill Clinton just spilled that fact, during a speech.

As a rule, the goal is not to unseat the incumbent, but to encourage him to adopt policies closer to your position, similar to 3rd party candidates in the general. The most successful examples are probably Robert Kennedy, whose primary challenge of Lyndon B. Johnson was predicted to beat him until his assassination, but did result in Johnson's defeat, and Theodore Roosevelt, whose primary run against Taft directly lead to Taft doubling down on harsh anti-trust laws, with Roosevelt's 3rd party run causing Taft's defeat in the general. General, primaries against sitting Presidents are tokens foisted to threaten the President in the general if he refuses to adopt certain positions. This was used effectively in the lead up to the '92 and '96 elections to pressure George W. Bush Sr. further left, and Bill Clinton further right leading into the elections, and it is probable that Bernie could threaten a primary of Joe Biden to split the party in 2024 unless Joe Biden adopts more progressive policies. However, again, that is not the plan. The plan to primary Joe Biden's chosen *replacement* most likely Kamala Harris, who already lost one primary to both Sanders and Warren.\",\"This isn't about the primaries but about a moron that the masses voted in  office in 2008, all because they fell in love with is smile.....\",\"There was a very similar phenomenon in the Democratic primaries. Bernie did not contest.\",\"&gt; That is of who is the next president.\\n\\nIt's more not so much about the *who* as it is about *what* will be our nation's policies in the coming years. And for anyone who wants those policies to be in any way progressive, aiding and abetting a Donald Trump presidency is absolutely indefensible from any rational standpoint. When you listen to them try to defend it, their motives are either incredibly selfish or incredibly stupid. The selfish ones are along the lines of, \\\"Hillary didn't earn *my* vote (because I'm just sooooo fucking important and being personally pandered to is more important than policies that affect people).\\\" And the stupid ones are along the lines of, \\\"Maybe after 4 years of Donald Trump, everyone will see the light and magically become ultra-progressive and we will have decades of presidents just like Bernie.\\\"\\n\\nAs for \\\"real\\\" supporters, Bernie and every other major political figure who has ever contributed to real progress on the issues he cares about have all come out swinging against Donald Trump and said they'll vote for Bill Clinton. Everyone who actually cares about these policies -- and I would say that actually caring about the views he represents is a fair requirement for a \\\"real\\\" Bernie supporter -- is united in opposition to Donald Trump. The holdout Bernie-or-busters are actually very much like Donald Trump's supporters, in that they're probably motivated more by blind rage at the establishment and cultish ingroup/outgroup thinking than by any rational concerns about policy. \",\"\\u201cExCuSe mE, I\\u2019m going to go read economic theory of a 19th century Eastern European.\\u201d\\n\\nWhich European? Why would you even throw that at the end of your argument? Also support for Bernie shouldn\\u2019t be conflated with a want for revolution, people just want change. For someone who is apparently \\u201cin the left\\u201d you use the same terminology as someone from r/TheDonald. The guy you are arguing with is completely right as well. It\\u2019s very hard to ignore Joe Biden\\u2019s allegations and political history along with the fact that he was never a rock solid candidate from the start. He had iffy support and you know it, he has a horrible track record for sexual misconduct and literal assault, and he can\\u2019t make a single speech without fluttering around like a mental patient. Joe Biden quite possible has dementia or something else hindering his ability to carry an interview and he is also avoiding them altogether. The Coronavirus has allowed him to sit on the sidelines as quietly as possible while the media starts to look into Tara Reade seriously. With all the distraction he is still losing his lead. Young feminists and progressives hate him, anti-war voters hate him, he is losing demographics by the minute. Most women won\\u2019t be too keen to vote for a rapist and may vote third party. This has nothing to do with a revolution. This is a weak candidate who has a horrible policy history who was propped up and could easily lose this election for us without it even really getting started. You guys have the audacity to blame progressives for this situation, if they wanted our vote they should\\u2019ve maybe given us some voice in the past 20 years. This is a product of misguided political regimes not the blunder of young progressives. You spit in the face of everyone who believes in anything when you get all pissed off that we don\\u2019t want to vote for a racist rapist who\\u2019s policy history is literally the same as many staunch Republicans. Of course so many people don\\u2019t want to vote for him he\\u2019s a regressive old dementia ridden molester who has a history of getting hands with kids and vehemently supporting the Iraq war and strict border control. Real charmer.\",\"Commented this on another post, but this still feels relevant. \\n\\nAs a Bernie supporter, it truly does astound me how little the voter turn-out was for the primaries. Don\\u2019t get me wrong, I know the DNC made their move the weekend before Super Tuesday against Bernie to make his chances slim, but the real fucking shame is that his base didn\\u2019t the counter the DNC by coming to vote in full force.\\n\\nAll of these anti-Joe Biden memes are meaningless, even if what you are accusing of him is true. Why don\\u2019t you guys actually do something productive and influence the Democratic Party to become more progressive? You know, like Bernie did? Voting for a third-party is not a viable option for people who cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump; and to act like four more years of this man in office would be just as devastating as four years of Joe Biden is just bewildering to me. Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell will continue vacating court seats and shape many significant political decisions for decades to come if they are able to stay in power.\\n\\nAll of you who won\\u2019t vote for Joe Biden on the premise that he\\u2019s a rapist, you\\u2019re allowing Donald Trump to get away with FAR more than what Joe Biden is being accused of. I don\\u2019t see a viable third-party option without inadvertently helping Donald Trump win the election. Remember, 100% Bernie Sanders supporter, but I\\u2019m willing to think about the well-being of others and understand that I have to make a sacrifice right now in order to defeat Donald Trump. Had his base actually turned out to vote, there wouldn\\u2019t have been any sacrifice to make. This is of our own doing and it\\u2019s cringey to see other people not take responsibility and just make shit-tier memes. Until we can come out and vote in full-force, sacrifices will have to be made and progressive policies will be stagnant.

He also said Bill Clinton was a good candidate, when she was the antithesis of everything he stood for policy wise.\\n\\nHe's also most definitely not the most dangerous president we've ever had, and anyone who actually believes that has never read a history book.

Why does Joe Biden hate WoC hmmmmmm\\ud83d\\ude0c\\ud83d\\ude0c\",\"&gt; Apparently, a lot of people share his opinions too.\\n\\nI've talked to quite a few Donald Trump supporters. (In the rural, majority Republican area where I live, based on yard signs Donald Trump is clearly the #1 candidate.)\\n\\nWhat I find is that Donald Trump supporters all disagree with him on one or more of Donald Trump's positions. A *huge* part of his appeal is that he \\\"tells it like it is\\\" and is not the typical Demopublican/Republocratic lawyer/politician who speaks in highly polished, mindless rhetorical platitudes.\\n\\nThere is also a *massive* frustration with Washington politics in general, and Donald Trump supporters express a view that he'll shake things up. YMMV.\\n\\nIMO Sanders could have tapped into the same veins of discontent and frustration, but instead of coming off as an actual socialist, Sanders has moved to the center and is portraying himself as just another neo-liberal Democrat.\",\"We\\u2019re supposed to say Bernie Sanders. Anything less would be going against the r/presidentialracememes circlejerk.\",\"He never had a chance BECAUSE of that unfair bias. He was labeled sexist, he was labeled anti semetic despite being Jewish. They dragged him as a \\\"communist\\\" trying to take all of your money away. They attacked at every single front.\\n\\nThe Democratic machine never intended to let Bernie win, and would have done anything to stop it. Including pushing a braindead centrist hack named Joe Biden as the nominee.\",\"&gt; brigaders\\n\\nI don't know where this \\\"brigading\\\" conspiracy theory is coming from. I'm not coordinating with anyone, and I haven't seen anyone on /r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/ rallying anyone.\",\"Really? So the MSM's blocking of Bernie Sanders in '16 wasn't driven by their profit and shareholders? Their never ending coverage in '16 of Donald Trump wasn't driven by their need for profit? The killing of 100,000+ Iraqi citizens wasn't partly to blame for the lack of any real journalism done on Saddam's WMDs? Fucking liberals, I swear to god.\",\"Or maybe I don't buy into fear mongering and refuse to support Bill Clinton after the dnc's treatment of Bernie supporters? If we vote for them after what they did then it shows they can just walk right over us and well still fall in line. Screw that.\",\"I understand it sucks that Bernie lost the primary. I understand that it\\u2019s sucks that Joe Biden is being accused of raping someone. But we HAVE to think about how Donald Trump is so dangerous to this country. We have to think of all the progressive ideas that we want to have in this country in the future. If Donald Trump wins because so many people voted third party when they could\\u2019ve voted for Joe Biden, RBG dies in the next 4 years, and the Supreme Court rules that gun control CANNOT be passed in the future because there is a conservative lean to the court, then what?? Think of all the Muslims in this country that can face discrimination as Donald Trump keeps adding more Muslim countries to the travel ban, making it impossible for their relatives to visit them. There are so many other examples of people suffering under Trumps presidency as well, we know them! We are all upset that Bernie lost but we HAVE to consolidate around Joe Biden or he will NOT win in November. I agree that his record is atrocious, but it is NOT as bad as Donald Trump, you have to agree with me on that. Also, unfortunately we live in a country with a two party system, and we don\\u2019t have ranked choice voting nationwide, so people are right when they say a vote for a third party is worthless, and when that vote could\\u2019ve been for Joe Biden, it is a vote for Donald Trump, guys cmon we KNOW this! I do not enjoy supporting someone accused of rape for president, nobody does, but please please think of the people that are SUFFERING because of trumps presidency. And consider helping them with your vote. Joe Biden needs it, and the people Donald Trump is hurting with his xenophobic and fear mongering words need it.\",\"Bernie lost because he thought everyone would stay in and he\\u2019d only need 30% of the vote. He then allowed his campaign to harass and alienate pretty much everyone who would align with him. He\\u2019s the only person to blame for his failure. The man spent time after Nevada taking victory laps on twitter rather than reaching out and gaining endorsements and support. Not to mention that he hired some of the worst possible choices to be his campaign staff. \\n\\nDid you really expect the Democrats to not coalesce around one candidate to stop the man who isn\\u2019t even a democrat and spends far too much time talking about how terrible they are from getting their nomination?\",\"The Entire reasoning behind Joe Biden should be supported over bernie was the myth of his electability and appeal to monstrous right wingers like George W. Bush. It's why they invited horrible neocons like John Kasich and Colin Powell to speak at the democratic national convention. Just like in the video I posted he ran to republicans looking for Brownie points and still in the end those people he's now saying are \\\"too far left\\\" saved his ass, while those conservatives he bent over backwards to swing went 94% for Donald Trump. This is exactly the problem in this election cycle.\",\"Probably hard to understand as an outsider.  It would make more sense if you lived here and followed the DNC's misinformation campaign and the media's complicity in that campaign of misinformation and spin.\",\"Let\\u2019s be honest. Every argument you make in favor of Joe Biden winning the primary is the exact same arguments you made during 2016. And Hillary lost really fucking bad. Hillary said Joe Biden\\u2019s campaign is really similar to hers. Which basically means he\\u2019s going to lose.\",\"It's obvious by now Fox News and Donald Trump were betting on running against Bernie. \\\"Radical left, killing God\\\". Thank baby Jesus bernie lost.\",\"I mean Sanders supporters were pretty determined that voter fraud occurred against him as well - I remember at least one such claim hitting the front page of reddit highly upvoted.  Where is the pants on fire for that?  Of course, that also wasn't the super specific out of context granularity of problem that polifact likes to boil things down to.  But I don't think it is as partisan as you make it out to be.\\n\\nOne of the links I found: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4mic9i/sanders_campaign_alleges_fraud_in_puerto_rico/\",\"The progressives bombed? Bernie lost because of his platform? Fuck. I always thought it was the DNC that paid people off. damnnnn\",\"No one is saying Warren cost Bernie the election by herself. Bernie cost himself some of it and the dnc made sure to capitalize and run an orchestrated election against him while the media blocked him out. He was repeatedly lumped in with \\\"other\\\" despite being in 2nd.\",\"Wonder if this message was approved by the DNC?\",\"I'm not focusing specifically on South Carolina.  Like I said, you can look at any state with a significant non-white population.  Sanders didn't just lose them, he got crushed.  It's why he lost.  In a system that allocates delegates proportionally based on vote count, every vote counts.\\n\\nYou say that it was known that Joe Biden was likely going to win those southern states.  Okay, so why didn't Bernie spend four years trying to win them instead?  Those states are the key to the nomination and that's what beat him in 2016.  They have Barack Obama the nomination too.  You blame everyone but Bernie even though Bernie is the one who failed to put together a winning strategy.  That's not James Clyburn or Bill Clinton's fault, that's Bernie's fault.\",\"Where is bernie mentioned? A sub that stops criticizing a terrible nominee because of outside influence is a bad thing. I\\u2019m done arguing. Bye\",\"He was mathematically eliminated from getting 1237 delegates but there was still a chance that by remaining in, he would also prevent Donald Trump from getting 1237 and achieving a contested convention.\",\"No one is \\u201cscreeching\\u201d or \\u201ccrying\\u201d, just pointing out the obvious DNC shenanigans in the primary.\\n\\nOf course Bernie\\u2019s campaign wasn\\u2019t perfect, but it was a hell of a lot better than Joe Biden\\u2019s. Bernie raked in $40+ million in small dollar individual donations in February 2020 alone. The policies that Bernie put at the core of his campaign (M4A, aggressive climate policy, getting big money out of politics) remain immensely popular among the American public - including moderates. So I\\u2019m not worried about winning elections based on the merits of policy. Had the primaries played out without DNC interference, Bernie would have won easily.\\n\\nUnless we fix the primary process we will continue to get neoliberal right-wing Dems shoved down our throat for the foreseeable future, and we will never get the chance to vote for the candidates who challenge the status quo in the general election. Both parties benefit from maintaining the status quo, and if you can\\u2019t see that then idk what to tell you.\",\"The griping is just that in the most diverse democratic candidate field we have had, in a time where everything is literally falling apart, democrats pick fucking Joe Biden.\\n\\nThat's the frustration, and it's not just about Bernie.\"],\"type\":\"bar\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"<b>Topic 8</b><br>Words: counts, charged, dunk, slam, disappointing\",\"<b>Topic 8</b><br>Words: prohibiting, anyhow, prosecuted,

Barr\\u2019s tireless efforts to help then-President Donald Trump escape accountability for his role in the Russia scandal.\\n\\nUnder the new attorney general, Merrick Garland, the department is attempting to keep secret a key memo from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) concerning the Russia investigation. It would shed light on the failure to prosecute the former president for obstruction of justice.\\n\\nThe department\\u2019s reticence is understandable in some ways. But it\\u2019s a mistake. In this case, transparency is a necessity.\\n\\nThis complicated story goes back to Barr\\u2019s effort to shape public understanding of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\u2019s report on Russia\\u2019s efforts to help get Donald Trump elected and Donald Trump\\u2019s efforts to scuttle an investigation into them.\\n\\nMueller\\u2019s report laid out evidence strongly suggesting the conclusion that Donald Trump had indeed committed extensive criminal obstruction of justice. But Mueller also concluded that some previous OLC analysis, which held that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, precluded him from explicitly saying what his evidence showed in terms of potential criminality.\\n\\nThe memo in question concerns Barr\\u2019s rationale for not charging Donald Trump. In justifying this decision, Barr cited an OLC memo he claimed he\\u2019d relied upon in making it.\\n\\nIn a case that began when Donald Trump was still president, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed suit to access the memo. Donald Trump\\u2019s Justice Department wanted to keep it secret.\\n\\nJoe Biden\\u2019s Justice Department has come to the same conclusion, arguing that since it relates to internal deliberations it shouldn\\u2019t be made public.\\n\\nBut in a ruling earlier this month, federal judge Amy Berman Jackson excoriated the department. Having read the memo, Jackson suggested it indicates that Barr and the department badly misled the public in claiming it as the rationale for not charging Donald Trump. She ordered the memo released.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what makes this so controversial. The department had claimed Barr relied on the OLC memo in his decision-making, as though it were some kind of neutral arbiter whose judgment he sought. But Jackson revealed that, in fact, the OLC memo was written in cooperation with Barr while he was making his own decision about how to handle Mueller\\u2019s report.\\n\\nIn essence, Barr and the OLC were, in Jackson\\u2019s words, working \\u201chand in hand to craft the advice\\u201d \\u2014 cooperating to form a strategy that would be most beneficial to Donald Trump.\\n\\nGiven all this, more transparency is called for. Noah Bookbinder, the president of CREW, notes that the memo could reveal in new detail just how far Barr went in perverting the law to protect Donald Trump.\\n\\n\\u201cWe may well see a sham legal analysis that was set up to publicly defend the president, not to answer a real legal question,\\u201d Bookbinder told us.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s at stake is whether we\\u2019ll ever fully understand the extent of the cover-up executed on behalf of Donald Trump by people who were supposed to be operating our legal machinery on behalf of the public and the national interest.\\n\\nThe Mueller report \\u201claid out devastating facts showing that the president of the United States likely repeatedly violated the criminal law of this country,\\u201d Bookbinder said. \\u201cBarr was able to confuse things enough that most people kind of missed that, and nothing ever came of it.\\u201d\\n\\nBookbinder added that if the memo is released, the public might want to revisit the question of whether Donald Trump should be held accountable now that he\\u2019s no longer president.\\n\\nIf the memo shows a \\u201cbogus analysis to facilitate a cover-up,\\u201d Bookbinder said, more people might say, \\u201cThere\\u2019s no reason for that case to be closed.\\u201d\\n\\nIt\\u2019s possible, of course, that this is a key reason for the reluctance to release the memo: If it does demonstrate that Donald Trump was protected in a highly corrupt way, it might increase pressure to revisit the case.\\n\\nTo be sure, there are other good reasons to keep internal deliberations about prosecutions private. But to say this is a unique case would be an understatement.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Justice Department always wants to protect its own lawyers, and they want to look out for confidentiality of documents,\\u201d Bookbinder told us. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m genuinely disappointed that they didn\\u2019t seem to grasp that this is an unusual situation.\\\"\\n\\nIn this case, the Justice Department was \\u201cmanipulated for the political and personal benefit of the president of the United States,\\u201d Bookbinder said, adding that the department now has \\u201can opportunity to come clean.\\u201d\\n\\nIf it doesn\\u2019t come clean, the department will be facilitating the act of keeping the public in the dark about its own previous misconduct on a corrupt American president\\u2019s behalf. But if it does, that would enable the department to put a very dark moment behind it and restore public credibility.\\n\\nAfter all, the misconduct that we saw over and over \\u2014 not just Donald Trump\\u2019s, but Barr\\u2019s as well \\u2014 constituted a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and to the rule of law. That being the case, we need to know everything we can about how it happened.\\n\\nEven if most such OLC memos should be kept private, this isn\\u2019t one of them. We need to know it all.\",\"More obstruction\",\"Or just set bail at the amount he claims he's worth. That'll fry his brain.\",\" Basically, you are right if the crime is done, we must act.

Congress can send the Sgt At Arms of the Senate to arrest the president and they can vote to remove him from office, but so long as he is in office there is no law enforcement body in America that can charge him with a crime.  The president of the United States *cannot be indicted* by the FBI for any crimes at all under any circumstances.
